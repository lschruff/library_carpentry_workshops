Microencapsulation is a viable method to improve the survivability of probiotics under harsh environmental conditions. In this research, microencapsulated Lactobacillus rhamnosus (MLR) was produced by a two-layer extrusion technique with sodium alginate and wild sage (Salvia macrosiphon) mucilage (SMM) in varying concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 0.8% as the first and second wall materials, respectively. The microencapsulation efficiency and second layer diameter of beads increased significantly with the increase in SMM concentrations. Microencapsulated Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) maintained its minimal concentration (6 log CFU/g) during 9\u2009min at 72°C. The MLR-date yogurt (DY) sample had the lowest pH, highest acidity, and highest survival rate among the others at the end of storage. In simulated gastrointestinal conditions (SGC), the survival rates of free LR (FLR) and MLR were 45% and 47% on the 14th day of storage, respectively. In sensory properties, MLR had the highest score in odor and texture parameters but not in others. The MLR viscosity (666.3\u2009mPa·s−1) and SEM images show a relatively denser structure for MLR. In conclusion, this study emphasized the potential of using double-layered beads to protect probiotics, providing valuable inspiration for developing new functional foods with higher survival ability in harsh conditions.']",public,['12(10):7630-7643'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWJiYXNpIFNhYWRpLCBNYWhzYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Abbasi Saadi, Mahsa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1055-646X', 'prefLabel': 'Sekhavatizadeh, Seyed Saeed'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7711-7934', 'prefLabel': 'Barzegar, Hassan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1447-5088', 'prefLabel': 'Alizadeh Behbahani, Behrooz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-1844', 'prefLabel': 'Mehrnia, Mohammad Amin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Date yogurt supplemented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 53103) encapsulated in wild sage (Salvia macrosiphon) mucilage and sodium alginate by extrusion: The survival and viability against the gastrointestinal condition, cold storage, heat, and salt with low pH']",2025-03-06T12:14:05.917+0100,286.0
frl:6510638,"[""Isothiocyanates (ITCs), prevalent in cruciferous vegetables, are known for their anticarcinogenic properties. Prior research has indicated that heparin can stimulate the growth of colon cancer cells. However, the implications of ITCs in the diet of cancer patients receiving heparin-based therapies have yet to be fully understood. This exploratory in vitro study examines the proliferative effects of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on human colon cancer cells and assesses the antiproliferative potential of four ITC compounds, exploring possible epidermal growth factor family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Erb-B) related mechanisms. We evaluated cell viability in HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines following treatment with ITCs alone or combined with LMWH (20\u2009μg/mL) at various concentrations (1–100\u2009μM). Clonogenic and wound-healing assays were performed after 24\u2009h of treatment with 5\u2009μM ITCs. Additionally, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Erb-B family genes was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting. Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's post hoc test. Results indicated that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), and Sulforaphane (SFN) were lower than those of Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in LMWH-stimulated HCT-116 (20.77, 19.10, and 44.05\u2009μM, respectively) and HT-29 (74.94, 26.77, and 43.49\u2009μM, respectively). PEITC and SFN significantly reduced ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) and ErbB4 (receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4) expression, while BITC decreased ErbB2 (receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) expression in HCT-116 cells (all, p\u2009<\u2009.05). PEITC, BITC, and SFN also increased proapoptotic Bax expression and decreased the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression (all, p\u2009<\u2009.05). These findings suggest that specific ITCs may mitigate cancer cell proliferation induced by LMWH in cancer therapies, highlighting their potential therapeutic efficacy.""]",public,['12(10):7842-7853'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0815-2397', 'prefLabel': 'zhang, yizi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FoYSwgS2FyYWJp', 'prefLabel': 'Saha, Karabi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmFuZGFuaSwgUmFq', 'prefLabel': 'Nandani, Raj'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVhbiwgSmlhaHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Yuan, Jiahui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV5LCBNb3Vs', 'prefLabel': 'Dey, Moul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3UsIFpoZW5ncm9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Gu, Zhengrong'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Isothiocyanates attenuate heparin-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro'],2025-03-13T11:58:54.001+0100,286.0

Some mitochondrial enzymes, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondria testicular protein, and body weight of rats were determined using standard methods. BPA significantly reduced succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase, and monoamine oxidase activity. Also, BPA prominently decreased the MMP, mitochondrial testicular protein, and body weight of rats. Interestingly, coadministration of BPA and CMSO restored the dysregulated activities of the enzymes and levels of other biomarkers.

Glycerol (Gl), corn starch (St), and parsley extract (PE) were used to improve the characteristics of the kombucha mushroom-based film. The physicochemical, thermal, and antibacterial properties of the films were investigated using different techniques. The obtained results showed that starch significantly increased the tensile strength of the film (3 Mpa) and glycerol improved the flexibility of the film (70%). Starch increased the film's resistance to dissolution in water, and parsley extract and starch improved water vapor permeability. The pure film of kombucha mushroom had good antioxidant (40%\u2009±\u20092%) and antibacterial properties, and parsley extract significantly increased these properties of the film, so that the prepared film can be considered as an active film. Starch had no significant effect on antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The pure kombucha mushroom film had cracks on the surface, and the addition of starch removed these cracks and made the structure of the film more homogeneous. Electrostatic interactions between kombucha mushroom, glycerol, starch, and parsley extract were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results. The pure film of kombucha mushroom was a completely amorphous film, which glycerol, parsley extract, and starch improved the crystallinity of the film. Glycerol and parsley extract decreased the thermal resistance of the film, but starch increased this property significantly (about 40°C), so that the kombucha mushroom/glycerol/starch/parsley extract composite film had the highest thermal resistance. In addition to having acceptable mechanical, thermal, and structural properties, the film based on kombucha mushroom can be used as an active film in the packaging of food products sensitive to microbial and oxidative spoilage due to having suitable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.""]",public,['12(10):7924-7937'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpcmksIFphaHJh', 'prefLabel': 'Shiri, Zahra'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6182-8798', 'prefLabel': 'pirsa, sajad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFyemksIEphZmFy', 'prefLabel': 'Farzi, Jafar'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Eco-friendly biodegradable film based on kombucha mushroom/corn starch/parsley extract: Physicochemical and antioxidant/antibacterial properties'],2025-03-17T10:47:27.057+0100,286.0
frl:6510380,"['BACKGROUND: Environmental traffic noise is a potential cause of hypertension. We aimed to study the association between hypertension as recorded in health insurance claims data and the exposure to three sources of traffic noise (aircraft, road and rail). METHODS: This large case-control study was conducted among persons aged 40 and above in 2010 and living in the region around Frankfurt airport in Germany. Individual residential noise exposure for the index year 2005 was assessed using standard noise algorithms. Cases were all newly diagnosed cases of hypertension recorded in three large health insurances databases in the period 2006–2010. Controls had no hypertension diagnosis. Categorical and continuous analyses were conducted with binary logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age and residential area-based socioeconomic information. RESULTS: The main analysis included 137,577 cases and 355,591 controls. There were no associations with any of the traffic noise sources. Odds ratios (OR) per 10 dB noise increase were 0.99 (95% confidence interval: 0.98;1.01) for aircraft noise, and 1.00 (0.99;1.01) both for road and railway noise. Similarly, nighttime noise levels showed no associations with hypertension. Odds ratios were increased for the subgroup of newly diagnosed hypertension cases with a subsequent diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease: per 10 dB aircraft noise there was a 13.9% OR increase (6.0% for road traffic, 5.4% for rail traffic). Increases were also noted when we analyzed cases with a longer exposure-outcome time window. CONCLUSION: Our results are suggestive of an association of noise exposure with clinically more severe hypertension diagnoses, but not with uncomplicated hypertension. The absence of individual confounder data, however, adds to the risk of bias. The results contribute to evidence on traffic noise as a cardiovascular risk factor.']",public,['157:110-117'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-242X', 'prefLabel': 'Zeeb, Hajo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVnZXdhbGQsIEphbmljZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hegewald, Janice'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWJlcnQsIE1lbGFuaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Schubert, Melanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FnbmVyLCBNYW5keQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Mandy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHLDtmdlLCBQYXRyaWs=', 'prefLabel': 'Dröge, Patrik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3dhcnQsIEVubm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Swart, Enno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2VpZGxlciwgQW5kcmVhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Seidler, Andreas'}]",2017.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Traffic noise and hypertension – results from a large case-control study'],2025-03-11T10:34:43.414+0100,317.0

These disruptions are evident across a spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression and autism spectrum disorders. Importantly, interactive patterns of prosocial and affiliative behavior can vary with sex. The fact that genders are differentially affected by neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social impairment underscores the high importance of this research in uncovering the underlying neural correlates and mechanisms.

frl:6510753,"['BACKGROUND: In 2016, the World Health Assembly adopted the resolution to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. This study aims to provide an overview of the burdens of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Europe and their changes from 2010 to 2019 using estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. METHODS: We used GBD 2019 estimates of the burden associated with HBV-related and HCV-related diseases: acute hepatitis, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and liver cancer. We report total numbers and age-standardised rates per 100\u2008000 for mortality, prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 2010 to 2019. For each HBV-related and HCV-related disease and each measure, we analysed temporal changes and percentage changes for the 2010–19 period. FINDINGS: In 2019, across all age groups, there were an estimated 2·08 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·66 to 2·54) incident cases of acute hepatitis B and 0·49 million (0·42 to 0·57) of hepatitis C in Europe. There were an estimated 8·24 million (7·56 to 8·88) prevalent cases of HBV-related cirrhosis and 11·87 million (9·77 to 14·41) of HCV-related cirrhosis, with 24·92 thousand (19·86 to 31·03) deaths due to HBV-related cirrhosis and 36·89 thousand (29·94 to 45·56) deaths due to HCV-related cirrhosis. Deaths were estimated at 9·00 thousand (6·88 to 11·62) due to HBV-related liver cancer and 23·07 thousand (18·95 to 27·31) due to HCV-related liver cancer. Between 2010 and 2019, the age-standardised incidence rate of acute hepatitis B decreased (–22·14% [95% UI –35·44 to –5·98]) as did its age-standardised mortality rate (–33·27% [–43·03 to –25·49]); the age-standardised prevalence rate (–20·60% [–22·09 to –19·10]) and mortality rate (–33·19% [–37·82 to –28·13]) of HBV-related cirrhosis also decreased in this time period. The age-standardised incidence rate of acute hepatitis C decreased by 3·24% (1·17 to 5·02) and its age-standardised mortality rate decreased by 35·73% (23·48 to 47·75) between 2010 and 2019; the age-standardised prevalence rate (–6·37% [–8·11 to –4·32]), incidence rate (–5·87% [–11·24 to –1·01]), and mortality rate (–11·11% [–16·54 to –5·53]) of HCV-related cirrhosis also decreased. No significant changes were observed in age-standardised rates of HBV-related and HCV-related liver cancer, although we observed a significant increase in numbers of cases of HCV-related liver cancer across all ages between 2010 and 2019 (16·41% [2·81 to 30·91] increase in prevalent cases). Substantial reductions in DALYs since 2010 were estimated for acute hepatitis B (–27·82% [–36·92 to –20·24]), acute hepatitis C (–27·07% [–15·97 to –39·34]), and HBV-related cirrhosis (–30·70% [–35·75 to –25·03]). A moderate reduction in DALYs was estimated for HCV-related cirrhosis (–6·19% [–0·19 to –12·57]). Only HCV-related liver cancer showed a significant increase in DALYs (10·37% [4·81–16·63]). Changes in age-standardised DALY rates closely resembled those observed for overall DALY counts, except for HCV-liver related cancer (–2·84% [–7·75 to 2·63]). INTERPRETATION: Although decreases in some HBV-related and HCV-related diseases were estimated between 2010 and 2019, HBV-related and HCV-related diseases are still associated with a high burden, highlighting the need for more intensive and coordinated interventions within European countries to reach the goal of elimination by 2030.']",public,['8(9):e701-e716'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R0JEIDIwMTkgRXVyb3BlIEhlcGF0aXRpcyBCICYgQyBDb2xsYWJvcmF0b3Jz', 'prefLabel': 'GBD 2019 Europe Hepatitis B & C Collaborators'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Hepatitis B and C in Europe: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019'],2025-03-21T10:23:43.374+0100,266.0
frl:6510760,"['Prediction models are used among others to inform medical decisions on interventions. Typically, individuals with high risks of adverse outcomes are advised to undergo an intervention while those at low risk are advised to refrain from it. Standard prediction models do not always provide risks that are relevant to inform such decisions: for example, an individual may be estimated to be at low risk because similar individuals in the past received an intervention which lowered their risk. Therefore, prediction models supporting decisions should target risks belonging to defined intervention strategies. Previous works on prediction under interventions assumed that the prediction model was used only at one time point to make an intervention decision. In clinical practice, intervention decisions are rarely made only once: they might be repeated, deferred, and reevaluated. This requires estimated risks under interventions that can be reconsidered at several potential decision moments. In the current work, we highlight key considerations for formulating estimands in sequential prediction under interventions that can inform such intervention decisions. We illustrate these considerations by giving examples of estimands for a case study about choosing between vaginal delivery and cesarean section for women giving birth. Our formalization of prediction tasks in a sequential, causal, and estimand context provides guidance for future studies to ensure that the right question is answered and appropriate causal estimation approaches are chosen to develop sequential prediction models that can inform intervention decisions.']",public,['66(8):e70011'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVpamtlbiwgS2lt', 'prefLabel': 'Luijken, Kim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yenl3b2xlaywgUGF3ZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Morzywolek, Pawel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIEFtc3RlcmRhbSwgV291dGVyIEEuQy4=', 'prefLabel': 'van Amsterdam, Wouter A.C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2luw6AsIEdpb3Zhbm5p', 'prefLabel': 'Cinà, Giovanni'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2397-6052', 'prefLabel': 'Hoogland, Jeroen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6504-3253', 'prefLabel': 'Keogh, Ruth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JpanRoZSwgSmVzc2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Krijthe, Jesse'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFnbGlhY2FuZSwgU2FyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Magliacane, Sara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIE9tbWVuLCBUaGlqcw==', 'prefLabel': 'van Ommen, Thijs'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVlaywgTmllbHM=', 'prefLabel': 'Peek, Niels'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5395-1422', 'prefLabel': 'Putter, Hein'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIFNtZWRlbiwgTWFhcnRlbg==', 'prefLabel': 'van Smeden, Maarten'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BlcnJpbiwgTWF0dGhldw==', 'prefLabel': 'Sperrin, Matthew'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgSnVuZmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Junfen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VpciwgRGFuaWFsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Weir, Daniala'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8587-7706', 'prefLabel': 'Didelez, Vanessa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5600-9093', 'prefLabel': 'van Geloven, Nan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Risk-Based Decision Making: Estimands for Sequential Prediction Under Interventions'],2025-03-21T12:22:25.749+0100,266.0

We aimed to compare the 13-year risk of developing CRC between persons with I) a higher-quality screening colonoscopy (higherQualSC), II) a lower-quality screening colonoscopy (lowerQualSC), and III) without a screening colonoscopy. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A health-care database (∼20% of the German population) was used to emulate a target trial with three arms: higherQualSC vs lowerQualSC vs noSC at baseline. The quality of screening colonoscopy was categorized based on the polyp detection rate of the examining physician (cut-off: 21.8%). We included persons aged 55–69 years at average CRC risk and CRC screening naïve at baseline. We estimated adjusted cumulative CRC incidence over 13 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The higherQualSC arm comprised 142,960 persons, the lowerQualSC arm 62,338 persons, and the noSC arm 124,040 persons. The adjusted 13-year CRC risk was 1.77% in the higherQualSC arm, 2.09% in the lowerQualSC arm, and 2.74% in the noSC arm. Compared to the noSC arm, the adjusted relative risk was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70–0.84) in the lowerQualSC arm and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60–0.69) in the higherQualSC arm.

This study aimed to assess the protective effects of walnut extract against HFD-induced toxicity in mice. The mice were fed HFD and walnut extract alone or in combination. The walnut extract was analyzed for composition using high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). Serum lipid profile; liver histology; hepatic antioxidants such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), and reduced glutathione (GSH); inflammatory markers like IL-6 and TNF-α; and phospholipids were determined. Results showed that phenolic acids, epicatechin, catechin, benzaldehyde, and juglone were the main constituents in the extract. The HFD group showed increased hepatic fat accumulation as evidenced by biochemical and histopathological examinations compared to the control animals. The HFD group mice also showed increased body and cardiac weights, modified lipid profiles, decreased antioxidant status, and increased levels of hepatic inflammatory markers. The weights of the body and heart, lipid profiles, antioxidant contents (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, TBARS, and GSH), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) were all normalized by consuming walnut extract. Similarly, the HFD group had significantly high amounts of hepatic lipase, phospholipid, and lysophospholipid levels, which were improved by walnut extract.

frl:6500696,"[""Two connected histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are chronic neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The accumulation of the most prevalent posttranslationally modified form of Aβ1-42, pyroglutamylated amyloid-β (Aβ3(pE)-42) in astrocytes is directly linked to glial activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines that in turn contribute to early synaptic dysfunction in AD. At present, the mechanisms of Aβ3(pE)-42 uptake to astrocytes are unknown and pharmacological interventions that interfere with this process are not available. Here we developed a simple screening assay to identify substances from a plant extract library that prevent astroglial Aβ3(pE)-42 uptake. We first show that this approach yields valid and reproducible results. Second, we show endocytosis of Aβ3(pE)-42 oligomers by astrocytes and that quercetin, a plant flavonol, is effective to specifically block astrocytic buildup of oligomeric Aβ3(pE)-42. Importantly, quercetin does not induce a general impairment of endocytosis. However, it efficiently protects against early synaptic dysfunction following exogenous Aβ3(pE)-42 application.

Selectivity, item difficulty, internal consistency, construct and factor validity, as well as factorial invariance were tested. Additionally, correlations and associations with depression, anxiety, and sociodemographic factors were determined. Furthermore, norm values were provided.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe RS-5 displayed robust psychometric properties. Participants reported an average resilience score of 28.94 (SD = 5.53, median = 30, IQR = 6, range = 5–35), with those aged ≥75 exhibiting the highest resilience levels (M = 30.21, SD = 5.75, median = 32, IQR = 7). The RS-5 displayed a very good model fit, affirming measurement invariance across sex and age decades. Construct validity found support through anticipated intercorrelations with related psychological constructs. Significant correlations (p < .001) linked higher resilience with female gender, advanced age, higher education, elevated household income, and diminished psychological distress.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThe RS-5 emerged as a reliable and economic instrument for assessing psychological resilience in individuals aged 25 to 86.

Semen Trigonellae (ST), the dried mature seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum L., has a long-standing traditional reputation for alleviating anxiety and hopelessness. However, the anti-depressant mechanism of ST remains poorly understood. This study aimed to assess ST's anti-depressant, as well as explore its potential mechanism from a gut microbial aspect. The Kunming mice were challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce depression-like behavior and then orally administrated with aqueous extract of ST. The behavioral test, and hippocampal and serum biochemical indicators were detected to assess anti-depressant effect of ST. We utilized full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate how ST influences gut microbiota modulation. Administration of ST mitigated LPS-induced depression-like behaviors. ST reversed the decrease in hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels while reducing serum levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Microbial analysis revealed that administration of ST markedly shifted the gut microbiota structure, dramatically and dose-dependently increased the abundance of Ligilactobacillus murinus and Ligilactobacillus animalis. Experimentally, oral administration of live L. murinus and L. animalis to LPS-challenged mice yielded similar effects to ST in ameliorating depression, elevating 5-HT and BDNF, and reducing proinflammatory cytokines. These findings provide evidence that ST is a promising medical food for the management of depression, in which modulation of the gut microbiota, particularly enhancing the abundance of Ligilactobacillus plays an important role.""]",public,['12(11):9414-9427'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhbmcsIFdlbmh1aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Chang, Wenhui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBKaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Jing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgWWFuYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Yanan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wm91LCBMaW5lbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zou, Linen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnUsIFl1', 'prefLabel': 'Fu, Yu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIE1pbmd4aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Mingxi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIExlaWxlaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Leilei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIENoZW54aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Chenxi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWGlueWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Xinya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbywgWGlhb2h1aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhao, Xiaohui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIENob25nbWluZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Chongming'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Semen Trigonellae alleviates LPS-induced depressive behavior via enhancing the abundance of Ligilactobacillus spp.'],2025-05-07T10:11:48.711+0200,286.0

frl:6511636,"['CONTEXT The transition to digital agriculture is likely to lead to systemic changes that will affect production, consumption, governance, and the wider environment of agricultural systems. Nevertheless, the absence of sufficient evidence and ambiguities in perspectives create an ongoing lack of clarity regarding the potential impacts of digital agriculture. Therefore, to discern potential impacts while addressing system complexities, uncertainties, as well as normative aspects associated with this transition, future-oriented and participatory assessments are needed that actively involve diverse knowledge and values of affected stakeholders. OBJECTIVE This research aims to explore the impacts and processes of agricultural digitalization according to stakeholders. The objectives are to identify key areas of impact that digital agriculture is likely to influence, identify and explore the causal pathways linking digital agriculture to impacts, and quantitatively examine the uncertainties of stakeholder perceptions associated with these impacts and causal pathways. METHODS Through a participatory modelling procedure, diverse stakeholders from the German region of Brandenburg constructed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The BBN facilitated the identification of the main impacts of digital agriculture and allowed for the modelling of uncertainties associated with these impacts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Stakeholders perceived several socioeconomic advantages of digitalization, particularly in terms of bolstering economic stability through improved risk management and enhanced resource use efficiency, validating existing claims in the literature. The perception seems to be influenced by highly variable yields and market uncertainties, as well as shortages in labour in the region. On the other hand, there was significant uncertainty among stakeholders concerning landscape diversification and its impact on biodiversity. This uncertainty arises from the potential profitability of cultivating marginal land under heightened digitalization-induced efficiency, posing a risk of diminishing natural habitat and landscape heterogeneity. Local historical trends toward landscape simplification as result of technology-driven efficiency improvements may be a cause for this perception. SIGNIFICANCE This study contributes to a growing body of future-oriented research assessing the impacts of digital agriculture through engaging stakeholder knowledge and values. While there is theoretical potential for digitalization to enhance biodiversity, realizing such positive impacts is improbable without improved communication and policy incentives, given the historical trend of efficiency-driven pathways. This study introduces a novel approach to assessing the impacts of agricultural digitalization through the application of a participatory Bayesian belief network.']",public,['224:104222'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFjUGhlcnNvbiwgSm9zZXBo', 'prefLabel': 'MacPherson, Joseph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9zbWFuLCBBbm5h', 'prefLabel': 'Rosman, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbWluZywgS2F0aGFyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Helming, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVya2hhcmQsIEJlbmphbWlu', 'prefLabel': 'Burkhard, Benjamin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A participatory impact assessment of digital agriculture: a Bayesian network-based case study in Germany'],2025-06-03T12:31:07.173+0200,333.0

The diversification of cropping systems, particularly through intercropping combined with shifts in sowing times, could have the potential to offset such negative impacts. Yet, both experimental data and simulation studies are scarce to elucidate the intercropping performance under future climate change conditions, particularly for evaluating its potential to offset climate impacts on crop and protein yields in German wheat-based systems. \r\nObjective: This study aimed to simulate the grain yield and grain protein performance of winter wheat-soybean relay-row intercropping across Germany under future climate conditions, comparing it to sole cropping systems. \r\nMethods: We employed the MONICA agroecosystem model and its intercropping module to simulate the performance of an innovative winter wheat–soybean relay intercropping system. This was in combination with a wide range of shifts in sowing dates, and we compared it against standard sole cropping under low and high emission scenarios across Germany. \r\nResults: The model projected a 15\u202f% higher sole wheat yield under the future (2031–2060) high emission scenario than that of the historical period (1981–2020), while sole soybean yield increased by 8\u202f% in the same case. Although the simulation of winter wheat–soybean relay intercropping across Germany indicated a 9\u202f% yield penalty compared to sole cropping in the future, with a transgressive overyielding index of 0.91, intercropping emerged as particularly advantageous in terms of land-use efficiency and protein production. It saved 17\u202f% of land compared to sole cropping, thus produced equal amounts of grain yield, and produced 16\u202f% more protein than sole cropping in the high emission scenario. On top of that, shifting the sowing dates of the component crops to earlier times was found to substantially enhance the advantages of intercropping, resulting in a maximum of 44\u202f% higher total yield production, and 47\u202f% higher protein production than sole wheat without shifting sowing date in the future projection window.\r\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the grain yield and protein production potential of intercropping versus sole cropping under futuristic high emission scenarios (RCP 8.5), and underscoring its potential to create a win-win situation of increased crop diversity and productivity. The results affirm the crucial importance of selecting optimal sowing dates for the component crops in intercropping, to maximize production and ensure resilience in the face of a changing climate.']",public,['322:109695'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIEppbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Jing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXlzaGkgUmV6YWVpLCBFaHNhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Eyshi Rezaei, Ehsan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVja2xpbmcsIE1vcml0eg==', 'prefLabel': 'Reckling, Moritz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmVuZGVsLCBDbGFhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Nendel, Claas'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Winter wheat–soybean relay intercropping in conjunction with a shift in sowing dates as a climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy for crop production in Germany'],2025-06-03T11:47:05.209+0200,333.0

A total of 189 digital technologies were found as of December 2023. Digital technologies in agriculture rarely contain few components. They consist of various other technologies that have many common interfaces. Therefore, a classification on two levels was done: technologies categorized according to their type (software-based and hardware-based technologies) and mode of operation (farm management information systems/ decision support systems, digital technologies for guidance and steering, digital information platforms, citizen science applications and platforms, sensors, field robots and unmanned aerial vehicles). Furthermore, the expected potentials of these digital tools for the promotion of nature conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in Germany were framed. The review also discusses barriers that can impact nature conservation and ecosystem service provisioning. Germany, as one of the world’s leading nations in the production and use of modern technologies, had set ambitious goals regarding digitalisation as a solution for nature conservation and ecosystem service provisioning problems, which have not yet been fulfilled. The potentials for nature conservation and ecosystem service provisioning are still strongly supressed by non-sustainable barriers, e.g., high acquisition costs, practical maturity, mode of operation and infrastructure. Current policies and societal preferences are not yet contributing enough to steer the use of digital technologies in a direction of nature conservation and providing ecosystem services. Furthermore, the main participants in the digitalisation discussion are researchers, whereby the smallest group of participants are farmers. For a sustainable digital transformation of agriculture, including restoration and protection targets of nature, and ecosystems, more wide-ranging, and diversifying changes supported by digitalisation are needed along agricultural and ecological concepts leading to long-term resilience of agricultural systems.']",public,['9:1464020'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhY2h1bm92YSwgVHN2ZXRlbGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Krachunova, Tsvetelina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VwcGVydCwgRnJhdWtl', 'prefLabel': 'Geppert, Frauke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVta2UsIE5haGxlZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lemke, Nahleen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVsbGluZ3JhdGgtS2ltdXJhLCBTb25va28gRG9yb3RoZWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Bellingrath-Kimura, Sonoko Dorothea'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Digital technologies commercially available in Germany in the context of nature conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in agriculture'],2025-05-20T15:41:30.575+0200,333.0

The success of FLR efforts depends on the interests, perceptions, and actions of local communities, extension services, Non-Governmental Organizations, and policymakers. While much research focuses on the direct ecological and economic impacts of FLR, limited attention has been given to how stakeholder perceptions influence the design and implementation of restoration efforts. Understanding these perspectives is crucial for shaping effective policy interventions and ensuring long-term FLR success. This study uses Q methodology to examine stakeholder viewpoints on key considerations and priorities for designing and implementing FLR in Tchamba Prefecture, Togo. The analysis reveals three distinct perspectives: (1) Incentive-Driven Restoration, emphasizing financial incentives and private-sector partnerships as essential for FLR success; (2) Comprehensive and Collaborative Restoration, advocating for an inclusive, multidisciplinary approach that integrates community participation and long-term monitoring; and (3) Incentive-Driven Community Restoration, highlighting the importance of economic incentives in fostering local engagement. Across all perspectives, stakeholders strongly agreed on the importance of biodiversity conservation, stakeholder involvement, and conflict resolution in land use. The findings underscore the need to tailor FLR policies to local contexts and stakeholder preferences, suggesting that flexible, participatory approaches can enhance sustainability and effectiveness.

frl:6511530,"['Decades of efficiency-oriented agricultural intensification have raised sustainability and resilience concerns. Diversification aims to address these issues but varies across time, space and system levels, which hinders an assessment of success of diversification and makes transfer to other regions difficult. We classified diversification measures from field to landscape through a systematic review of 142 papers on intensive agricultural systems in temperate climates. Most measures were at field and farm levels, with fewer at landscape level. Since biodiversity requires provision and maintenance at the landscape level rather than just at the field or farm level, the limited emphasis on landscape-level diversification measures highlights a significant knowledge gap. We further analyzed the impact of diversification on sustainability (integration of environmental, economic, social targets) and resilience capacities (robustness, adaptation, transformation). We show that specific diversification levels were linked to specific sustainability targets and resilience capacities. Environmental aspects are mainly addressed at the field level, economic aspects at the farm level, and social aspects, which are less frequently addressed, are also primarily tackled at the farm level. Resilience is often equated with robustness towards economic (farm) stability. Adaptation relates to climate change and economic instability, while transformation, though rarely addressed directly, emphasizes societal change. Our findings suggest that the concepts of resilience and sustainability are interconnected: resilience can be understood as a property of a system, while sustainability is the overarching target. In literature, transformation relates to societal changes for better integrating social, economic and environmental targets. In contrast, robustness and adaptation address environmental or economic aspects with less linkage to integration of sustainability as a whole. While agricultural diversification is often associated with improved resilience and sustainability, most studies on diversification remain vague about the causal linkage to those concepts. Literature on diversification often focuses only on individual aspects of sustainability or resilience, which undermines both concepts, as it is the holistic consideration of all aspects together that makes a system sustainable or resilient. Our research highlights that diversification at all spatial levels is necessary to achieve resilient and sustainable systems, as each level of diversification addresses distinct sustainability goals or resilience capacities.']",public,['385:109547'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJuZHQsIE1hcmll', 'prefLabel': 'Arndt, Marie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbWluZywgS2F0aGFyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Helming, Katharina'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Agricultural diversification across spatial levels - a contribution to resilience and sustainability?'],2025-05-26T14:50:08.186+0200,333.0

This study aims to analyze income from the diversification strategies of cocoa producers by building the typology of the most common systems and assessing their impacts on household income. A survey of 303 households across five Côte d’Ivoire regions reveals that cocoa producers have four distinct types of production systems, namely: (1) simple cocoa production systems; (2) cocoa production systems with crops in association; (3) cocoa production systems combined with income generating diversification on the additional plot; and (4) cocoa production systems, and food cropland. Of the four systems, type 3 is the most widely adopted by cocoa producers, generating higher income per household than the other types due to the large part of perennial income that requires a larger area. Furthermore, type 2 presents the best cocoa yield. We also assessed differences per population group. Thus, the results show that women adopt type 2 and type 4 systems with less surface area and are more devoted to the production of subsistence crops. Non-Ivorian producers have systems with higher cocoa yields and income from diversification than Ivorian producers. However, only 7% of producers have access to financing enabling them to invest in diversification crops. The findings demonstrate that crop diversification strategies can successfully improve households’ living income and ensure the sustainability of cocoa production.']",public,['9: Article 1524997'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9rb3UsIEJvbm5hIEFudG9pbmV0dGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Tokou, Bonna Antoinette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29yYWwgR3VlcnJhLCBDbGF1ZGlhIFN0ZXBoYW5pZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Coral Guerra, Claudia Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9udGllbCwgRmxvcmEgSXNhYmVsbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Montiel, Flora Isabella'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWRvdSBZYW8sIENvbnN0YW50IFl2ZXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Adou Yao, Constant Yves'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYmVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO2aHIsIEthdGhhcmluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Löhr, Katharina'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Diversification strategies to improve cocoa farmers’ household income: the case of Côte d’Ivoire'],2025-05-26T14:41:02.126+0200,333.0

The rhizosphere was sampled at four sites, which captured a complete tillage erosion gradient from extremely eroded to depositional soils. The gene abundances characteristic of microbial N cycle guilds were assessed via metagenomics. The eroded sites showed the lowest plant productivity and soil mineral N availability, which was associated with an enrichment of glnA in the rhizosphere. Genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate-to-ammonium reducers and diazotrophy prevailed in the eroded soil profiles. The strongest correlations of the biomasses of rye plants along the catena with N cycle functions were observed for norBC. Thus, tillage erosion as a legacy of agricultural management aligns with substantial differences in rhizosphere microbiome functionality in N cycling.

Our analysis showed that stricter environmental legislation, together with complementary supply- and demand-related drivers, induced various farm responses.

We identified 108 potential determinants of farmers’ behaviour, which were integrated into a multilevel framework. The results show that the farmers’ decisions are complex and often non-directional processes, shaped by numerous external (at a society, landscape, community, and farm level) and internal factors. These factors are embedded in regional and cultural contexts. However, the analysis of study sites indicates that the spatial coverage of scientific evidence on biodiversity-friendly farming measures is uneven across Europe. Given the diversity of local and socio-cultural conditions, there is a need for public policies, including the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, to address more specifically determinants encouraging biodiversity-friendly farm management. This entails reflecting culture-specific perspectives and incorporating experiential knowledge into multilevel policy design processes, as well as offering regionally adapted advice on measure implementation and biodiversity impacts.']",public,['41(2):831-861'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4877-3160', 'prefLabel': 'Klebl, Fabian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5978-5944', 'prefLabel': 'Feindt, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6936-5118', 'prefLabel': 'Piorr, Annette'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Farmers’ behavioural determinants of on-farm biodiversity management in Europe: a systematic review'],2025-02-03T09:57:38.859+0100,333.0

One area of focus has been the microbiome of the trees and the application of biocontrol agents (BCAs). In this study, we aimed to find suitable BCAs that can help control Hymenoscyphus fraxineus and the resulting ash dieback. Therefore, we studied the health of ash seedlings under nursery conditions via inoculation with beneficial bacterial isolates and consortia to suppress the pathogen. By using offspring of two tolerant ash trees, we aimed to optimize this via synergistic effects. We found that Schauerella fraxinea B3P038 and Luteimonas fraxinea D4P002 lowered the symptoms of ash dieback. Using strain-specific qPCR assays, only the persistence of Aureimonas altamirensis C2P003 could be proven in the inoculated ash seedlings. Similarly, the fungal pathogen was also unable to infect the plants during the summer months. In addition, we were able to show that the inoculated bacterial strains influenced the microbiome, even without persisting on the plants. These results are encouraging, as positive effects can be taken from the greenhouse to the field and further studies should follow up on the B3P038, C2P003 and D4P002 strains. However, under field conditions, a strong variation in the effects must be considered. This strongly suggests that in addition to plant scoring, monitoring inoculation success as well as pathogen abundance is necessary.']",public,['132(1):9'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVyZ2hhcmQsIFZhbGVudGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Burghard, Valentin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VuZGUsIFNvbmph', 'prefLabel': 'Wende, Sonja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobmVjaywgVm9sa2Vy', 'prefLabel': 'Schneck, Volker'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3854-9608', 'prefLabel': 'Ulrich, Andreas'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Inoculation of Fraxinus excelsior seedlings with bacterial strains to enhance the tolerance against ash dieback'],2025-05-26T09:20:22.688+0200,333.0

Changes in land use, its intensity and the quality of management have significant impacts on soil health and soil related ecosystem services. A systems analysis of soil health dynamics requires an understanding of the drivers inducing changes in land use and management. The DPSIR framework was adapted to the context of soil health in the European Union (EU) and used as an analytical framework for identifying the drivers for soil health. A scoping literature review, divided in four parts based on different land use types (urban and industrial, agriculture, forest, and nature), was conducted using the PRISMA protocol. The identified drivers across all land uses have been adjusted and standardised in in-person and online workshops. This metadata set presents the typology of drivers sorted according to the EU soil mission's soil health objectives, land use type, and location. The literature review was conducted as part of SOLO (Soils for Europe), a EU´s Horizon Europe funded project and the dataset will support the co creation and knowledge developing platforms (think tanks) for each EU soil mission objectives.""]",public,['57:111064'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2474-3015', 'prefLabel': 'Chowdhury, Shaswati'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dm9uIFBvc3QsIE1hcmlh', 'prefLabel': 'von Post, Maria'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-4146-0435', 'prefLabel': ', Roger Roca Vallejo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-9301-5338', 'prefLabel': 'Naciph Mora, Karen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3431-1785', 'prefLabel': 'Hultman, Jenni'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8094-775X', 'prefLabel': 'Pennanen, Taina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGluZHJvb3MsIEFudHRpLUp1c3Np', 'prefLabel': 'Lindroos, Antti-Jussi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbWluZywgS2F0aGFyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Helming, Katharina'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Drivers of soil health across European Union – Data from the literature review'],2025-05-15T09:29:23.435+0200,333.0

Intensive crop production has induced increased greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced nutrient and pesticide leaching to groundwater and streams. Climate change is also expected to increase drought risk as well as the frequency of extreme precipitation events in many regions. Consequently, sustainable management schemes require sound knowledge of site-specific soil water processes that explicitly take into account the interplay between soil heterogeneities and crops. In this study, we applied a principal component analysis to a set of 64 soil moisture time series from a diversified cropping field featuring seven distinct crops and two weeding management strategies.\r\n\r\nResults showed that about 97\u2009% of the spatial and temporal variance of the data set was explained by the first five principal components. Meteorological drivers accounted for 72.3\u2009% of the variance and 17.0\u2009% was attributed to different seasonal behaviour of different crops. While the third (4.1\u2009%) and fourth (2.2\u2009%) principal components were interpreted as effects of soil texture and cropping schemes on soil moisture variance, respectively, the effect of soil depth was represented by the fifth component (1.7\u2009%). However, neither topography nor weed control had a significant effect on soil moisture variance. Contrary to common expectations, soil and rooting pattern heterogeneity seemed not to play a major role. Findings of this study highly depend on local conditions.

The amendment of local sediments to cropland can potentially alleviate these challenges, but responses are variable. In this study, we investigated the potential of two different local sediments influenced by volcanic deposits to increase soil pH, Si and P availability and reduce Al toxicity, thereby improve barley yield. Hence, a field experiment was established in Eldoret, Western Kenya, using 1% and 3% addition by weight of two sediments in barley cultivated plots. The Baringo 3% amendment significantly increased soil pH (from 4.7 to 7.0), the available P content (from 0.01 mg g−1 to 0.02 mg g−1) and decreased the Al availability (from 3.03 mg g−1–2.17 mg g−1). This resulted in a barley yield of 4.7 t/ha (+1061%). The Nakuru 3% and Baringo 1% amendments increased yield to 2–3 t/ha, while the Nakuru 1% did not significantly increase yield. These results highlight that, from a biophysical perspective, there are natural and local opportunities to reduce soil acidification and to partly replace mineral fertilizer, but its magnitude depends on the sediment and the amendment rate.']",public,['12:1458360'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoZXJ3aWV0ZXMsIEVyaWM=', 'prefLabel': 'Scherwietes, Eric'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RlaW4sIE1hdGhpYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Mathias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2l4LCBKb2hhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Six, Johan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lwbGFnYXQgQmF3ZW4sIFRpdHVz', 'prefLabel': 'Kiplagat Bawen, Titus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoYWxsZXIsIErDtnJn', 'prefLabel': 'Schaller, Jörg'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Local sediment amendment can potentially increase barley yield and reduce the need for phosphorus fertilizer on acidic soils in Kenya'],2025-05-19T09:23:05.822+0200,333.0

Diversity was assessed and compared with Hill diversity values, using the iNext framework. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of variance were used to compare species composition at different field boundaries and to search for variables that drive species composition at the local scale. The results revealed that both species diversity and composition differed significantly between the inner and outer boundary along the crop edges and at the field margins. Local site conditions, namely a moisture gradient, influenced the species composition of the field margins, resulting in differences between the inner and outer field margins.

frl:6511744,"['Collecting and preserving biological samples in the field, particularly in remote areas in tropical forests, prior to laboratory analysis is challenging. Blood samples in many cases are used for nucleic acid-based species determination, genomics or pathogen research. In most cases, maintaining a cold chain is impossible and samples remain at ambient temperature for extended periods of time before controlled storage conditions become available. Dried blood spot (DBS) storage, blood stored on cellulose-based paper, has been widely applied to facilitate sample collection and preservation in the field for decades. However, it is unclear how long-term storage on this substrate affects nucleic acid concentration and integrity. We analysed nucleic acid quality from DBS stored on Whatman filter paper no. 3 and FTA cards for up to 15\u2009years in comparison to cold-chain stored samples using four nucleic acid extraction methods. We examined the ability to identify viral sequences from samples of 12 free-ranging primates in the Amazon forest, using targeted hybridization capture, and determined if mitochondrial genomes could be retrieved.

The taxonomy within the genus Mastophorus and the cryptic diversity among the genus are controversial among taxonomists. This study provides a detailed morphological description of M. muris from Mus musculus combined with a molecular phylogenetic approach. Moreover, descriptions and molecular data of M. muris from non-Mus rodents and wildcats complement our findings and together provide new insights into their taxonomy. The analysis of M. muris was based on light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The morphological description focused on the dentition pattern of the two trilobed pseudolabia. Additionally, we described the position of the vulva, arrangement of caudal pairs of papillae, spicules and measured specimens from both sexes and the eggs. For the molecular phylogenetic approach, we amplified the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer, and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1. Mastophorus morphotypes based on dentition patterns and phylogenetic clustering indicate a subdivision of the genus in agreement with their host. We recognize two groups without a change to formal taxonomy: One group including those specimens infecting Mus musculus, and the second group including organisms infecting non-Mus rodents. Our genetic and morphological data shed light into the cryptic diversity within the genus Mastopohorus. We identified two host-associated groups of M. muris.

Successful reproduction in captivity plays a key role in maintaining such a genetically diverse ex situ population but is challenged by reproductive loss in the form of abortions and stillbirths. The elephants’ biphasic prolactin pattern led us to predict a higher incidence of abortions during the time of reduced prolactin concentrations. Therefore, this study focuses on the identification of months during elephant gestation which are prone to loss of pregnancy. A metric was developed to identify the fetal age of aborted calves based on the fetal mass using a regression model. Data on idiopathic abortions in captive and wild elephants collected from zoos, tourist camps, semi-captive, and free-ranging populations since 1974 were analyzed, revealing a significantly higher prevalence of abortions during the 15th and 17th month of gestation. Additionally, the prevalence of stillbirths in the 22nd month of gestation between 2000 and 2023 was assessed. Although stillbirths showed a declining trend over time, the average prevalence between 2019 and 2023 was still 2.8%. Consequently, the 15th, 17th, and 22nd month of gestation were identified as stages prone to pregnancy loss. These findings underscore the necessity of researching risk factors and preventative measures for pregnancy loss in these 3 months, especially exploring a possible link with prolactin during the 15th and 17th month of gestation. The identification of stages prone to fetal loss is a key step towards enhancing elephant reproductive success and welfare.']",public,['43(6):575-579'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVpanNtYW5zLCBUaW0gRS4gUi4gRy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Huijsmans, Tim E.

We analyzed camera-trapping data within a multi-species Royle–Nichols occupancy framework to estimate occupancy and species richness within three management zones. We used anthropogenic and ecological covariates to understand the factors influencing species occurrence in the study site. In total, we detected 40 terrestrial mammals over 20 794 camera-trap days, including five Annamite endemics and 18 threatened species, of which 26 had sufficient detections to be included in the multi-species occupancy analysis. We found that overall species richness increased with remoteness and elevation. Mean ± SD predicted species richness in the three management zones was 14.6 ± 1.55 (Zone 1-Thong Khacheng), 13.18 ± 1.64 (Zone 2-Thong Kouang), 11.84 ± 1.15 (Zone 3-Nam Chae), with an average of 13.26 ± 2.03.

frl:6511718,"['The increasing use of onshore wind energy is leading to an increased deployment of wind turbines in structurally rich habitats such as forests. Forest-affiliated bats, in turn, are at risk of colliding with the rotor blades. Due to the legal protection of bats in Europe, it is imperative to restrict the operation of wind turbines to periods of low bat activity to avoid collisions. However, bats have also been observed to avoid wind turbines over several hundred meters distance, indicating a displacement that cannot solely be explained by modifications to the habitat. This avoidance suggests a displacement of bats by indirect factors related to wind turbine operation, e.g., wake turbulences and noise emissions. Therefore, we investigated whether the activity of forest-affiliated bats is influenced by operation mode (on/off) under variable wind conditions along transects from 80 to 450 m distance to wind turbines. We divided recordings by foraging guild, i.e., either narrow-space (Myotis, Plecotus), edge-space (Pipistrellus, Barbastella), or open-space foraging bats (Nyctalus, Eptesicus, Vespertilio), and analyzed the effects of wind turbine operation and wind speed on the recorded bat guild activity with mixed effects models. The acoustic activity of narrow-space foraging bats decreased by 77% with increasing wind speed when wind turbines were operating, while bat activity remained unaffected by wind speed when turbines were not operating. This was neither observed for open-space foraging bats nor for edge-space foraging bats, and neither wind turbine operation nor wind speed (ranging between 0 – 4 m/s at 10 m height above ground) were found to affect bat activity when considered alone. Wind turbine noise emissions are known to increase with rotor speed and consequently, wind speed, thus presenting a likely explanation for the interactive negative effect of turbine operation and wind speed specifically on noise-sensitive narrow-space foraging bats. To understand potential ecological long-term consequences for bat populations in forest areas with wind turbines and to design effective conservation measures, future research should focus on disentangling the effects of different disturbances related to turbine operation.']",public,['49:e02782'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxsZXJicm9rLCBKdWxpYSBTLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ellerbrok, Julia S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFyd2lnLCBOaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Farwig, Nina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0ZXIsIEZyYW56aXNrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Peter, Franziska'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9pZ3QsIENocmlzdGlhbiBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian C.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Forest bat activity declines with increasing wind speed in proximity of operating wind turbines'],2025-06-12T07:22:09.163+0200,336.0

Nevertheless, our understanding of how different environments shape the extent of social information use remains limited. Here, we assessed the advantages and disadvantages of contrasting foraging strategies in different environments in terms of vulture and carcass density, at the individual, population and ecosystem level. We built an agent-based model to simulate three foraging strategies of African white-backed vultures in Namibia: nonsocial, local enhancement, and chains of vultures. This model incorporated field-derived parameters including vulture and carcass density, and flight characteristics of foraging vultures. From the model outputs, we calculated searching efficiency, competition for resources, and scavenging efficiency and compared the results with observed field data. The results highlight social foraging strategies as overall more advantageous than the nonsocial strategy. The chains of vultures strategy outperformed local enhancement only in terms of searching efficiency under high vulture densities. Furthermore, our findings suggest that vultures in our study area likely adopt diverse foraging strategies influenced by variations in vulture and carcass density. The model developed in this study is potentially applicable beyond the specific study site, rendering it a versatile tool for investigating diverse species and environments.

The results demonstrated that all strains within the intervention groups exhibited good performance to prevent colitis. Particularly, the SS18-50-H strain exhibited a pronounced stimulative effect on GSH, an increase in SOD activity, and a decrease in MPO activity and MDA content. The SS18-50-H treatment resulted in a notable elevation in serum somatostatin (SS) levels and a concomitant reduction in endothelin (ET) and substance P (SP) levels, which approached normal ranges. The results of the RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), interleukin (IL-10), and interleukin (IL-6) in the SS18-50-H were significantly reduced to levels comparable to those observed in the CON.

This study aims to determine the prevalence of GC use among patients with RMD and understand their perceptions of GC use and safety. This cross-sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary academic university hospital in Amman, Jordan. RMD patients were anonymously approached while awaiting rheumatology clinic appointments. Convenience sampling was employed, with enrollment taking place between January and September 2021. Of 500 participants, 315 (63%) reported current (171/315, 54.3%) or past (144/315, 45.7%) use of GCs, primarily prescribed for RMD (267/315, 84.7%). Most (270/315, 85.7%) used GCs orally, with the majority taking them daily (266/315, 84.4%). A small percentage (33/315, 10.5%) used GCs only as needed. Long-term use was common, with 57.8% (182/315) reporting use for years and 84.1% (265/315) adhering to doctor recommendations. Perception-wise, 69.5% (219/315) of GC users believed in its efficacy, whereas 78.7% (248/315) considered it unsafe, compared to 51.9% (96/185) of non-users. Awareness of side effects was higher among GC users (219/315, 69.5%) than non-users (79/185, 42.7%), with weight gain being the most reported side effect. Media and personal research were the primary information sources for GC users (193/315, 61.3%). Side effects were reported by 110/315 (34.9%) GC users, with weight gain as the most common (47%). Both perceived efficacy and safety of GC were positively and significantly correlated with educational level (p\u2009=\u2009.005, p\u2009=\u2009.000, respectively) and monthly income (p\u2009=\u2009.044, p\u2009=\u2009.000, respectively).

Here, a pariwise signature, including genes ICAM2 and OSTF1, was derived based on a rank-based method, which was called ICAM2-OSTF1 signature (IOS). The sensitivity and specificity of IOS in the training dataset were 87.39% and 86.79%, respectively. The accuracy of IOS was 91.07% in the validation dataset that contained a total of 280 samples from two independent datasets. Besides, when using eight methods, such as ssGSEA, xCell and TIMER, to quantitate the immune infiltration characteristics in RA. We found that RA presented elevated pro-inflammation immune infiltration and immune score. In addition, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the consistent transcriptional differences between RA and healthy control were significantly enriched in some pathways typically related to the immune microenvironments, such as T cell activation. Finally, network analysis demonstrated that ICAM2, CXCL16, CKLF and SLPI may be related to the occurrence of RA. In brief, IOS can individually distinguish RA from healthy controls measured by different laboratories, and be an auxiliary test for diagnosing RA.']",public,['20(6):e0326027'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3UsIEhhbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Su, Hang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFhpbmd5aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Xingyi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-5253', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yawei'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Individualized diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis: A rank-based qualitative T cell-related signature'],2025-07-16T10:52:49.040+0200,355.0

However, there is concern that by neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, nMAbs may decrease the availability of antigens to the immune system, potentially impairing the endogenous polyclonal immune response and decreasing long-term immune protection.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe compared 28 and 90-day anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralization activity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid response for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection randomized to receive nMAbs or placebo in the large platform ACTIV-3/TICO trials. We pooled results from four trials of anti-spike nMAbs. For most tested agents, measurements of the spike protein response reflect both the therapeutic and endogenous immune response. Anti-nucleocapsid levels reflect only the endogenous immune response. Data are summarized as mean differences in percent binding inhibition (anti-spike) and signal-to-cutoff (S/C) ratio (anti-nucleocapsid). Linear mixed effects models were fit to compare the longitudinal trajectory between treatment and placebo groups.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nOf 2,254 participants in the ACTIV-3/TICO trials modified intention-to-treat population, 2,149 (95.3%) had antibody measures at baseline and at least 1 follow-up day (day 1, 3, or 5) and were included in this analysis. Antibody measures were available for 1,556 (72.4%) participants at day 28 and 1,429 (66.5%) participants at day 90. In participants who received nMAbs, anti-spike neutralization activity was higher at day 28 (mean difference in percent binding inhibition: 7.1% [95%CI: 5.3, 8.9], p\u2009<\u20090.001) and day 90 (mean difference in percent binding inhibition: 7.2% [95% CI: 5.4, 9.0], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Anti-nucleocapsid response was similar at day 28 (mean difference in S/C ratio: 0.02 [95%CI: −0.11, 0.15], p\u2009=\u20090.75) and day 90 (mean difference in S/C ratio: 0.08 [95% CI: −0.05, 0.21], p\u2009=\u20090.22). Similar patterns were observed in all trials.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nIn patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with nMAbs did not decrease long-term anti-nucleocapsid response compared to placebo, suggesting neutralizing therapies do not suppress the endogenous humoral immune response in this population.\r\n']",public,['20(6):e0325561'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3353-612X', 'prefLabel': 'Munroe, Elizabeth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JhbmRpdHMsIEdyZWcgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Grandits, Greg A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHl6eSwgUm9iZXJ0IEMu', 'prefLabel': 'Hyzy, Robert C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJlc2NvdHQsIEhhbGxpZSBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Prescott, Hallie C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFycmV0dCwgVGhvbWFzIFcu', 'prefLabel': 'Barrett, Thomas W.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV3YXIsIFJvYmluIEwu', 'prefLabel': 'Dewar, Robin L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RW5nZW4sIE5pY29sZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Engen, Nicole'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0643-9017', 'prefLabel': 'Goodman, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3755-4309', 'prefLabel': 'Hatlen, Timothy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlnaGJhcmdlciwgSGVsZW5l', 'prefLabel': 'Highbarger, Helene'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7745-9010', 'prefLabel': 'Holland, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVnaGVzLCBHYXJldGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Hughes, Gareth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmVuc2VuLCBUb21hcyBPLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Jensen, Tomas O.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbiwgTXVoYW1tYWQgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Muhammad A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2Fsb21lbmlkaXMsIElvYW5uaXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Kalomenidis, Ioannis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FuZywgTmF5b24=', 'prefLabel': 'Kang, Nayon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGF2ZXJkdXJlLCBTeWx2YWlu', 'prefLabel': 'Laverdure, Sylvain'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuaWFuLCBQcmFzYWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Manian, Prasad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVub24sIFZpZHlh', 'prefLabel': 'Menon, Vidya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGF0ZWwsIFJhdmk=', 'prefLabel': 'Patel, Ravi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFtYWNoYW5kcnVuaSwgU3Jpa2FudGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Ramachandruni, Srikanth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVobWFuLCBUYXVzZWVm', 'prefLabel': 'Rehman, Tauseef'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhdy1TYWxpYmEsIEthdGhyeW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UsO4Z2UsIEJpcmdpdCBUaG9ydXA=', 'prefLabel': 'Røge, Birgit Thorup'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9jaywgRGF2aWQgTS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Vock, David M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VpbnRyb2IsIEFteSBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Weintrob, Amy C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WW91bmcsIEJhcm5hYnkgRS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Young, Barnaby E.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJvc2NoLCBBbm5lIFAu', 'prefLabel': 'Frosch, Anne P.'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Long-term anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody trajectories after neutralizing monoclonal antibody treatment'],2025-07-17T11:29:41.319+0200,355.0

However, no previous studies have characterized the cellular immunological effects of camel milk in the context of allergic asthma. Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the protective effects of camel milk in house dust mite induced asthma in mice, which emulate human pulmonary inflammation. Female BALB/c mice aged 8- to 10-week-old were intranasally sensitized with vehicle or HDM in 2.5 µl (5 µg) per nostril, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. On day 22, mice received an HDM challenge by a large volume but low dose into the lung (5 µg in 50µl) using intranasal inoculation. Using oral gavage technique, CM/HDM group mice received 0.5\u2009ml of camel milk or vehicle five times a week, starting a day prior to sensitization. On day 23 following HDM challenge, mice were exposed to serial challenges with 10, 20, 40 and 100\u2009mg/ml aerosolized methacholine to measure lung dynamics. Furthermore, BALF and whole lung samples were harvested to examine pulmonary inflammation. Camel milk effectively inhibited both HDM-induced infiltration of eosinophils and AHR. In addition to this, camel milk downregulates the number of pulmonary Th2 and Th17 cells and suppressed CCL17 expression in whole lung homogenates. Furthermore, camel milk reduced HDM-induced IL-4 and IL-13 expression following in vitro restimulation of pulmonary T cell subsets. Additionally, camel milk suppressed total concentrations of IL-5 and IL-13 in the lung. These results corroborate the asthma-preventive potential of camel milk and highlight the significance of diminished local concentrations of Th2- associated cytokines. In the present study, the observed downregulation of asthma progression by camel milk suggests its potential health benefits; however, further experimental and controlled clinical trials are needed before it can be considered a supplementary approach for allergic asthma management.']",public,['20(6):e0327504'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFraG1hdHVsaW5hLCBBeWF1bHlt', 'prefLabel': 'Rakhmatulina, Ayaulym'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2VuZW5iYXksIFNoeW5hcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Kenenbay, Shynar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWJ1b3ZhLCBBbHR5bmF5', 'prefLabel': 'Abuova, Altynay'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2l6YXRvdmEsIE1haWd1bA==', 'prefLabel': 'Kizatova, Maigul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWJyYWlraGFuLCBBa25peWV0', 'prefLabel': 'Ibraikhan, Akniyet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWJhZHVsbGF5ZXZhLCBHYWxpeWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Ibadullayeva, Galiya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hvbWFub3YsIFVyaXNoYmF5', 'prefLabel': 'Chomanov, Urishbay'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVyemFidWxhdG92LCBBa2htZXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Murzabulatov, Akhmet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXppbW92YSwgU2FuYXZhcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Azimova, Sanavar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VscGlpc292YSwgQWx0eW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Kulpiisova, Altyn'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6616-0179', 'prefLabel': 'Bayantassova, Svetlana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJhbGJheWV2LCBOdXJiZWs=', 'prefLabel': 'Aralbayev, Nurbek'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SW1hbmJheWV2YSwgTnVyYmliaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Imanbayeva, Nurbibi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGlraGFuYmF5ZXZhLCBGYXRpbWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Dikhanbayeva, Fatima'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVyYW1iYXlldmEsIE5hZGV6aGRh', 'prefLabel': 'Burambayeva, Nadezhda'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U21hZ3Vsb3ZhLCBOYXpndWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Smagulova, Nazgul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXNzaW1vdiwgQXJtYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Issimov, Arman'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2hpdGUsIFBldGVy', 'prefLabel': 'White, Peter'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The effect of camel milk on house dust mite allergen induced asthma model in BALB/C mice'],2025-07-15T08:46:03.314+0200,355.0

The primary objectives of this research were to determine the clinical characteristics of CRKP MSI, and the risk factors of infection and mortality. \r\nMETHODS:\r\nPatients with a CRKP bloodstream infection (BSI) were enrolled retrospectively between January 2017 and December 2021 in Xijing Hospital, China. The risk factors for CRKP MSI and mortality were evaluated. The demographic data, clinical and microbiological characteristics, therapy and outcomes were analyzed.\r\nRESULTS: \r\nAmong 101 patients, 74.3% (75/101) had a diagnosis of CRKP MSI, while 25.7% (26/101) of CRKP non-MSI. The overall case fatality rate was 42.6% (43/101).

Using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to explore the impact of this external stressor on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of women with SARD in a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: Females aged 18–50 with SARD were enrolled from 04/2021 to 04/2022 at the Medical University of Vienna or through an online self-help group, while snowball sampling was used to recruit an age-matched healthy control group. Participants completed questionnaires including: (1) demographic information, medical history, and access to healthcare; (2) the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); and (3) the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Parameters were compared between groups using Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact, and Mann–Whitney U tests. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate which individual factors predicted the DASS-21 in women with SARD. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 226 women (n = 99 with SARD and n = 127 healthy controls). Women with SARD reported lower DASS-21 stress (p = 0.008) and CAS scores (p = 0.057) than the control group. There were no significant differences in DASS-21 anxiety or depression scores. Among women with SARD, a linear regression model identified the most important predictors of DASS-21 as access to rheumatological care (p = 0.002) and recent disease activity (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pandemic, women with SARD reported mental health outcomes equal to or better than those of the healthy control group. Continued access to rheumatological care may serve as an important protective factor for their mental health during large-scale crises like pandemics.']",public,['14(14):5038'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-3763-2914', 'prefLabel': 'Rosenberg, Nora'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF6enVjYXRvLVB1Y2huZXIsIEFudG9uaWEg', 'prefLabel': 'Mazzucato-Puchner, Antonia '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuZGwsIFBldGVyIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Mandl, Peter '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8763-8215', 'prefLabel': 'Ritschl, Valentin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3073-7284', 'prefLabel': 'Stamm, Tanja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3502-3734', 'prefLabel': 'Rosta, Klara '}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Symptoms in Women with Rheumatic Disease of Reproductive Age: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic']",2025-07-21T11:23:45.352+0200,355.0

We retrospectivity evaluated PD-L1 expression in thymomas and thymic carcinomas using two antibodies, SP142 and SP263, and compared their expression rates in each type of TETs.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nWe retrospectively included 37 cases of thymoma and 11 cases of thymic carcinoma that were histologically diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2020. PD-L1 expression was assessed using SP142 and SP263 antibodies with semi-quantitative scoring.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe concordance rate for PD-L1 positivity between SP142 and SP263 was 81.2%, whereas the concordance rate for high PD-L1 expression was 83.3%. SP142 showed positive PD-L1 expression in 23 (62%) thymoma cases and eight (73%) thymic carcinoma cases. In contrast, SP263 antibody showed positive PD-L1 expression in 31 (84%) cases of thymoma and 9 (82%) cases of thymic carcinoma. In addition, type B thymomas exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 positivity than other thymoma types. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were mostly CD3 and CD8 positive. No significant difference in overall survival was observed between the high and low PD-L1 expression groups in thymic carcinoma.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nPD-L1 expression rate was high in TETs, with variations depending on the antibody used and histological subtype. SP263 showed higher PD-L1 expression compared to SP142. The type of the antibody used should be considered when evaluating PD-L1 expression in TETs.\r\n']",public,['20(7):e0327792'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3016-5036', 'prefLabel': 'Chubachi, Kei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuYWthLCBIaXNhc2hp', 'prefLabel': 'Tanaka, Hisashi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFpbWEsIEthZ2Vha2k=', 'prefLabel': 'Taima, Kageaki'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFzYWthLCBTYWRhdG9tbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Tasaka, Sadatomo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3Vyb3NlLCBBa2lyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kurose, Akira'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in thymic epithelial tumors detected with SP142 and SP263 antibodies'],2025-07-11T10:03:05.664+0200,355.0

We investigated the influence of host genetic admixture and environmental factors on the intestinal prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities (fungi, parasites) of two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus domesticus and M. m. musculus) and their hybrids in two settings: (i) wild-caught mice from the European hybrid zone and (ii) wild-derived inbred mice in a controlled laboratory environment before and during a community perturbation (infection). In wild-caught mice, environmental factors strongly predicted the overall microbiome composition. Subspecies' genetic distance significantly influenced the overall microbiome composition, and each component (bacteria, parasites and fungi). While hybridization had a weak effect, it significantly impacted fungal composition. We observed similar patterns in wild-derived mice, where genetic distances and hybridization influenced microbiome composition, with fungi being more stable to infection-induced perturbations than other microbiome components. Subspecies' genetic distance has a stronger and consistent effect across microbiome components than differences in expected heterozygosity among hybrids, suggesting that host divergence and host filtering play a key role in microbiome divergence, influenced by environmental factors.

frl:6511364,"[""Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and both positive and negative associations of individual inflammation-related markers with brain structure and cognitive function have been described. We aimed to identify inflammatory signatures of CSF immune-related markers that relate to changes of brain structure and cognition across the clinical spectrum ranging from normal aging to AD. A panel of 16 inflammatory markers, Aβ42/40 and p-tau181 were measured in CSF at baseline in the DZNE DELCODE cohort (n = 295); a longitudinal observational study focusing on at-risk stages of AD. Volumetric maps of gray and white matter (GM/WM; n = 261) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs, n = 249) were derived from baseline MRIs. Cognitive decline (n = 204) and the rate of change in GM volume was measured in subjects with at least 3 visits (n = 175). A principal component analysis on the CSF markers revealed four inflammatory components (PCs). Of these, the first component PC1 (highly loading on sTyro3, sAXL, sTREM2, YKL-40, and C1q) was associated with older age and higher p-tau levels, but with less pathological Aβ when controlling for p-tau. PC2 (highly loading on CRP, IL-18, complement factor F/H and C4) was related to male gender, higher body mass index and greater vascular risk. PC1 levels, adjusted for AD markers, were related to higher GM and WM volumes, less WMHs, better baseline memory, and to slower atrophy rates in AD-related areas and less cognitive decline. In contrast, PC2 related to less GM and WM volumes and worse memory at baseline. Similar inflammatory signatures and associations were identified in the independent F.ACE cohort. Our data suggest that there are beneficial and detrimental signatures of inflammatory CSF biomarkers. While higher levels of TAM receptors (sTyro/sAXL) or sTREM2 might reflect a protective glia response to degeneration related to phagocytic clearance, other markers might rather reflect proinflammatory states that have detrimental impact on brain integrity.

In a survey with a representative sample of the German population, participants answered questions about foxes in two consecutive years. Different versions of a leaflet about foxes were distributed to 2448 participants before the second interview. We compared a narrative text presentation to a non-narrative list of facts and examined the use of photographs and schematic graphs. We assessed how the presentation format and socio-demographic factors affected the probability that participants read the leaflet. Using a before-after/control-impact design, we examined whether the leaflet affected people's fox-related knowledge, attitude, and risk perception. The results show that participants were more likely to read the leaflet with increasing age and a higher educational level. Reading probability also increased with attitude toward foxes. Participants who read the leaflet completely gained more knowledge about foxes than those who read it only partly. Photographs also contributed to a higher knowledge gain, but schematic graphs did not. Moreover, participants who read a fact list gained more knowledge compared to the control condition. Furthermore, the combination of visual and textual features had an effect on attitude toward foxes. However, we found no evidence that any treatment affected risk perception.

METHODS: We developed a multi-stage process, consisting of a scoping and two Delphi stages with web-based surveys and invited public health stakeholders in Switzerland to participate: First, respondents specified topics for different public health domains, which were reformulated in a PICO format by content analysis. Second, respondents rated the topics using five stakeholder-refined assessment criteria. Overall rankings were calculated to assess differences between stakeholder groups and rating criteria. RESULTS: In total, 215 respondents suggested 728 topics altogether. The response rate in the two Delphi stages was 91.6% and 77.6%, respectively. Most top-rated review topics focused on the effectiveness of interventions providing education to different target groups, followed by interventions to increase access to specific healthcare services. CONCLUSION: Our approach encourages involvement of stakeholders in identifying priorities for systematic reviews and highlights disparities between stakeholders and between individual criteria.']",public,['69:1606642'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9la3N0cmEsIER5b24=', 'prefLabel': 'Hoekstra, Dyon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcO8dHNjaCwgTWFyZ290', 'prefLabel': 'Mütsch, Margot'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9yY2hhcmQsIEFubmVncmV0', 'prefLabel': 'Borchard, Annegret'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2llbiwgQ2hyaXN0aW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Kien, Christina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JpZWJlciwgVXJzdWxh', 'prefLabel': 'Grieber, Ursula'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9uIEVsbSwgRXJpaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Von Elm, Erik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVoZnVlc3MsIEV2YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Rehfuess, Eva'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VyaGFyZHVzLCBBbnNnYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Gerhardus, Ansgar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGhhY2hpbWksIFN0ZWZhbiBLLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lhachimi, Stefan K.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A structured approach to involve stakeholders in prioritising topics for systematic reviews in public health'],2025-08-28T11:04:27.399+0200,266.0

The inclusion of β-sitosterol into various health-related formulations has widened its potential in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Process optimization ensures the maximum efficiency, consistency, and yield. In the current study, we employed mutual interaction effect to extract the β-sitosterol from the root bark of Berberis jaeschkeana using ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) technique. In order to identify the optimal extraction parameters, we conducted a series of 29 experiments, varying factors, such as amplitude level, solid-to-liquid ratio, extraction time, and temperature. The mutual interaction effect encompasses several key components, including the Box–Behnken design, assessment of model fitness, coefficient of determination, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the creation of three-dimensional (3D) response curves of response surface methodology (RSM). The outcomes of the analysis revealed notable model fitness, highlighting the presence of linear, quadratic, and interactive effects among the various factors examined. The optimized UAE conditions (amplitude level of 30%, time of 10\u2009min, solid-to-liquid ratio of 20, and temperature at 50°C) were applied. Under the most favorable extraction conditions, the β-sitosterol was identified and quantified from Berberis jaeschkeana using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The β-sitosterol yield was measured at 43.52\u2009mg per gram of the sample. Conclusively, the optimization approach for UAE using the mutual interaction effect contributes to a more rapid extraction process, resulting in a higher yield of β-sitosterol. Furthermore, this study design could be extended to other valuable species or compounds to efficiently extract nutraceutical compounds and enhance the sustainable utilization of natural products.']",public,['12(10):8211-8219'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1689-4408', 'prefLabel': 'Raza, Awais'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8610-2686', 'prefLabel': 'Akhtar, Muhammad Nadeem'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFxYm9vbCwgVGFoaXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Maqbool, Tahir'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbGlsLCBBbmVlcyBBaG1lZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Khalil, Anees Ahmed'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0756-1225', 'prefLabel': 'Hassan, Mohamed'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Optimization of ultrasonically extracted β-sitosterol from Berberis jaeschkeana using response surface methodology'],2025-03-25T10:18:06.395+0100,286.0

This work was created to assess how various factors influence the fact that we like to eat meat, fish, and seafood. Exploring these relationships will contribute to our understanding of why dietary interventions for the above foods may be so difficult to implement in some groups of people. Two hundred eighty-three people living in Poland took part in the study. An interview and olfactory tests were conducted together with assessments of food preferences from 25 types of food products. The extent to which sex, age, body mass index, tobacco addiction, and sense of smell influence ‘meat, fish and seafood’ consumption was assessed. Using the factor analysis, a coherent group of ‘meat, fish and seafood’ products was selected: beef, pork, veal, cured meats, poultry, fish dishes, and seafood. ‘Meat, fish and seafood’ was liked more by men, compared to women (B\u2009=\u2009.85; CI\u2009=\u2009.60, 1.10; t\u2009=\u20096.66, η2\u2009=\u2009.14; p\u2009<\u2009.001), whereas other factors did not affect the preference of dishes from this group as a whole. A detailed analysis of each type of food separately showed, however, that not only is gender important, but fish is liked more by older people, and cured meats by people who identify odors more efficiently. When planning a diet change, including the products mentioned above, we should consider the sex and age of the person to whom the diet is addressed, because men declare a higher derived pleasure from eating various types of meat, fish, and seafood than women, while older people like fish more.']",public,['12(9):6799-6809'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3986-3295', 'prefLabel': 'Hartman-Petrycka, Magdalena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGViaWVkb3dza2EsIEFnYXRh', 'prefLabel': 'Lebiedowska, Agata'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FtacWEc2thLCBNYWdkYWxlbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Kamińska, Magdalena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3J1c2llY_KAkMWad2lkZXJnb8WCLCBCZWF0YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Krusiec‐Świdergoł, Beata'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QsWCb8WEc2th4oCQRmFqZnJvd3NrYSwgQmFyYmFyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Błońska‐Fajfrowska, Barbara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2l0a2-FmywgSm9hbm5h', 'prefLabel': 'Witkoś, Joanna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lsY3p5xYRza2ksIFPFgmF3b21pcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wilczyński, Sławomir'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Who likes meat, fish, and seafood?

This rich biodiversity is under threat from anthropogenic drivers, such as climate change, invasive species, land use changes, overexploitation, or pathogen (re)emergence. The inventory, characterisation, and study of biodiversity at inter- and intra-specific levels using genomics is crucial to promote its preservation and recovery by informing biodiversity conservation policies, management measures, and research. The participation of researchers from Portuguese institutions in the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) initiative and its pilot effort to generate reference genomes for European biodiversity has reinforced the establishment of Biogenome Portugal. This nascent institutional network will connect the national community of researchers in genomics. Here, we describe the Portuguese contribution to ERGA’s pilot effort, which will generate high-quality reference genomes of six species from Portugal that are endemic, iconic, and/or endangered and include plants, insects, and vertebrates (fish, birds, and mammals) from mainland Portugal or the Azores islands. In addition, we outline the objectives of Biogenome Portugal, which aims to (i) promote scientific collaboration, (ii) contribute to advanced training, (iii) stimulate the participation of institutions and researchers based in Portugal in international biodiversity genomics initiatives, and (iv) contribute to the transfer of knowledge to stakeholders and engaging the public to preserve biodiversity. This initiative will strengthen biodiversity genomics research in Portugal and fuel the genomic inventory of Portuguese eukaryotic species. Such efforts will be critical to the conservation of the country’s rich biodiversity and will contribute to ERGA’s goal of generating reference genomes for European species.']",public,['3(1):27'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFycXVlcywgSm-Do28gUC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Marques, João P.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx2ZXMsIFBhdWxvIEMu', 'prefLabel': 'Alves, Paulo C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1vcmltLCBJc2FiZWwgUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Amorim, Isabel R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG9wZXMsIFJpY2FyZG8gSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lopes, Ricardo J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW91cmEsIE1vbmljYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Moura, Monica'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXllcnMsIEV1Z2VuZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Myers, Eugene'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2ltLXNpbSwgTWFudWVsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Sim-sim, Manuela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U291c2EtU2FudG9zLCBDYXJsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Sousa-Santos, Carla'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx2ZXMsIE0uIEp1ZGl0ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Alves, M.

Therefore, we hypothesized whether the pristane-induced lupus mice model shows early activation of neutrophils, the presence of low-density granulocytes (LDGs), and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release, which could contribute to the development of a lupus phenotype. METHODS: Twelve female wild-type Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with pristane (n = 6; pristane group) or saline (n = 6; control group). Five days after the injection, blood, peritoneal lavage, bone marrow, and spleen samples were collected for flow cytometry analyses of activated neutrophils (Ly6G+CD11b+), LDGs (CD15+CD14low), and NETs release (Sytox Green+). RESULTS: The pristane-induced mice group had a significantly increased number of blood activated neutrophils and LDGs as well as NETs released by these cells compared to the saline-injected control group and the basal values determined 12 days before the injection. The pristane group also had a significantly increased number of activated neutrophils, LDGs, and NETs released compared to the control group for the peritoneal lavage and bone marrow, except total cell count in spleen. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated early changes in the innate immune response such as an increased number of activated neutrophils and LDGs and mainly increased NETosis in the pristane-induced mice model which may be considered as the primary event triggering lupus development.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0306943'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2469-9744', 'prefLabel': 'Carrasco, Solange'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlwaGF1cywgQmVybmFkZXRlIEwu', 'prefLabel': 'Liphaus, Bernadete L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVpeG90bywgVGF0aWFuYSBWYXNjb25jZWxvcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Peixoto, Tatiana Vasconcelos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGltYSwgVGhhaXMgTWFydGlucw==', 'prefLabel': 'Lima, Thais Martins'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJpZ2EsIFN1ZWxpIEt1bmltaSBLdWJv', 'prefLabel': 'Ariga, Sueli Kunimi Kubo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmVzdXMgUXVlaXJveiwgWmVsaXRhIEFwYXJlY2lkYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jesus Queiroz, Zelita Aparecida'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGUgTWF0b3MgTG9ibywgVGhheXM=', 'prefLabel': 'de Matos Lobo, Thays'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2F0YW5vemksIFNlcmdpbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Catanozi, Sergio'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9kcmlndWVzLCBMZXTDrWNpYSBHb21lcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Rodrigues, Letícia Gomes'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmlsaG8sIEFudMO0bmlvIFNhbnRvcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Filho, Antônio Santos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVvZG9ybywgV2FsY3kgUm9zb2xpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Teodoro, Walcy Rosolia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVsb3NhLCBBbmEgUGF1bGEgUGVyZWlyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Velosa, Ana Paula Pereira'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGV2eSwgRMOpYm9yYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Levy, Débora'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4898-0135', 'prefLabel': 'Soriano, Francisco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29sZGVuc3RlaW4tU2NoYWluYmVyZywgQ2zDoXVkaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Goldenstein-Schainberg, Cláudia'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Early neutrophil activation and NETs release in the pristane-induced lupus mice model'],2025-04-02T14:50:45.344+0200,337.0

frl:6510020,"['INTRODUCTION: Pharmacovigilance is vital for drug safety. The process typically involves two key steps: initial signal generation from spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) and subsequent expert review to assess the signals’ (potential) causality and decide on the appropriate action. METHODS: We propose a novel discovery and verification approach to pharmacovigilance based on electronic healthcare data. We enhance the signal detection phase by introducing an ensemble of methods which generated signals are combined using Borda count ranking; a method designed to emphasize consensus. Ensemble methods tend to perform better when data is noisy and leverage the strengths of individual classifiers, while trying to mitigate some of their limitations. Additionally, we offer the committee of medical experts with the option to perform an in-depth investigation of selected signals through tailored pharmacoepidemiological studies to evaluate their plausibility or spuriousness. To illustrate our approach, we utilize data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database, focusing on drug reactions to the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. RESULTS: In this example, the ensemble method is built upon the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, longitudinal Gamma Poisson shrinker, penalized regression and random forests. We also conduct a pharmacoepidemiological verification study in the form of a nested active comparator case-control study, involving patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who initiated anticoagulant treatment between 2011 and 2017. DISCUSSION: The case study reveals our ability to detect known adverse drug reactions and discover new signals. Importantly, the ensemble method is computationally efficient. Hasty false conclusions can be avoided by a verification study, which is, however, time-consuming to carry out.

frl:6510943,"['BACKGROUND: The genus Astragalus is the largest and one of the most diverse genera of flowering plants, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, with a significant concentration of species in the Irano-Turanian region. Within this genus, section Hymenostegis is notable for its complexity and high levels of endemism, especially in northwestern Iran. During recent field explorations in West Azarbaijan province, a distinct population of Astragalus was identified, differing from known species within section Hymenostegis. This study aimes to describe and analyze this new species and clarify its relationship with closely related taxa using an integrative approach. RESULTS: Astragalus kuzehrashensis sp. nov. is described following detailed morphological comparisons with its closest relatives, A. chehreganii and A. hakkianus. The new species is distinguished by unique stipule characteristics, leaflet shape, inflorescence structure, and seed micromorphology. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using ITS and ycf1 sequences reveals that A. kuzehrashensis forms a clade with A. chehreganii and A. hakkianus, although it exhibits genetic differences. Genome size estimation confirms that A. kuzehrashensis is hexaploid (2n = 6x = 48), aligning it more closely with A. hakkianus than with the tetraploid A. chehreganii. The distinct morphological characters and genomic data support recognizing A. kuzehrashensis as a new species within section Hymenostegis. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of A. kuzehrashensis underscores the importance of an integrative taxonomic approach, combining morphological, molecular, and cytogenetic data to resolve species boundaries within complex groups like Astragalus section Hymenostegis. This study highlights the rich biodiversity of the Irano-Turanian floristic region, emphasizing the need for ongoing exploration and conservation efforts, particularly in areas of high endemism.

frl:6489597,"['Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly emerging as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique. TUS is already well-established in animal models, providing foundations to now optimize neuromodulatory efficacy for human applications. Across multiple studies, one promising protocol, pulsed at 1000 Hz, has consistently resulted in motor cortical inhibition in humans (Fomenko et al., 2020). At the same time, a parallel research line has highlighted the potentially confounding influence of peripheral auditory stimulation arising from TUS pulsing at audible frequencies. In this study, we disentangle direct neuromodulatory and indirect auditory contributions to motor inhibitory effects of TUS. To this end, we include tightly matched control conditions across four experiments, one preregistered, conducted independently at three institutions. We employed a combined transcranial ultrasonic and magnetic stimulation paradigm, where TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) served as an index of corticospinal excitability. First, we replicated motor inhibitory effects of TUS but showed through both tight controls and manipulation of stimulation intensity, duration, and auditory masking conditions that this inhibition was driven by peripheral auditory stimulation, not direct neuromodulation. Furthermore, we consider neuromodulation beyond driving overall excitation/inhibition and show preliminary evidence of how TUS might interact with ongoing neural dynamics instead. Primarily, this study highlights the substantial shortcomings in accounting for the auditory confound in prior TUS-TMS work where only a flip-over sham and no active control was used. The field must critically reevaluate previous findings given the demonstrated impact of peripheral confounds. Furthermore, rigorous experimental design via (in)active control conditions is required to make substantiated claims in future TUS studies. Only when direct effects are disentangled from those driven by peripheral confounds can TUS fully realize its potential for research and clinical applications.']",public,['12:RP88762'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29wLCBCZW5qYW1pbiBS', 'prefLabel': 'Kop, Benjamin R'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhbWxpIE9naGxpLCBZYXphbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Shamli Oghli, Yazan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JpcHBlLCBUYWx5dGEgQw==', 'prefLabel': 'Grippe, Talyta C'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmFuZGksIFR1bGlrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Nandi, Tulika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVma2VzLCBKdWRpdGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Lefkes, Judith'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVpamVyLCBTam9lcmQgVw==', 'prefLabel': 'Meijer, Sjoerd W'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFyYm91ZCwgU29oYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Farboud, Soha'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RW5nZWxzLCBNYXJ3YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Engels, Marwan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFtYW5pLCBNaWNoZWxsZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hamani, Michelle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TnVsbCwgTWVsaXNzYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Null, Melissa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFkZXR6LCBBbmdlbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Radetz, Angela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzc2FuLCBVbWFpcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hassan, Umair'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFybWFuaSwgR2hhemFsZWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Darmani, Ghazaleh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hldHZlcmlrb3YsIEFuZHJleQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Chetverikov, Andrey'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGVuIE91ZGVuLCBIYW5uZWtlIEVN', 'prefLabel': 'den Ouden, Hanneke EM'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVyZ21hbm4sIFRpbCBPbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bergmann, Til Ole'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgUm9iZXJ0', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Robert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVyaGFnZW4sIExlbm5hcnQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Verhagen, Lennart'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T2JsZXNlciwgSm9uYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Obleser, Jonas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9pc2VyLCBKb25hdGhhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Roiser, Jonathan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Auditory confounds can drive online effects of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation in humans'],2025-01-29T08:16:00.563+0100,336.0

This study integrates phylogenomics and cytogenetics to infer the parental origin of C. bachofenii and establish its diagnostic morphological characteristics. Genome skimming of C. bachofenii and 10 other C. ser.

The allopolyploid origin of C. bachofenii (2n = 16) was confirmed with C. vernus as the maternal parent. The probably extinct paternal parent was affiliated with a clade comprising C. heuffelianus, C. tommasinianus, C. kosaninii, and C. bertiscensis. Morphologically, C. bachofenii is distinguished by larger flowers, perigone segment coloration, and a stigma-anther ratio from its close relatives.

Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach, however, discrepancies between preclinical animal models and human cancers complicate translation to clinical outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of immunotherapy on primary and metastatic tumor regression in animal models of MBC and assessed the models’ appropriateness and reproducibility to improve future preclinical study design. Following a preregistered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42021207033), we conducted searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases, yielding 2255 studies for title/abstract screening and 108 studies included after full-text screening. All included studies used mouse models, assessing primary outcomes through tumor volume or weight and metastatic outcomes via nodule count or bioluminescence. Only 14% of studies fully reported experimental animal characteristics, and 43% provided detailed experimental procedures. Of 105 articles (293 comparisons) included in the meta-analysis, pooled effect sizes indicated significant reductions in both primary and metastatic tumors. However, high heterogeneity across studies and wide prediction intervals suggested substantial variability in model responses to immunotherapy. Univariable and multivariable meta-regressions failed to significantly explain this heterogeneity, suggesting additional factors may influence outcomes. Trim-and-fill and Egger’s regression tests indicated funnel plot asymmetry, implying potential publication bias and small study effects. While our analysis demonstrated positive effects of immunotherapy on MBC and highlighted variability in animal tumor models, addressing model-related heterogeneity and enhancing methodological transparency are essential to improve reproducibility and clinical translatability.']",public,['20(5):e0322876'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0755-3508', 'prefLabel': 'Mirzaei, Yalda'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SMO8ZmZlbCwgTWFydGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hüffel, Martina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWNDYW5uLCBTYXJhaA==', 'prefLabel': 'McCann, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFubmFjaC1Ccm93biwgQWxleGFuZHJh', 'prefLabel': 'Bannach-Brown, Alexandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9sYmEsIFJlbsOpIEgu', 'prefLabel': 'Tolba, René H.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RlaXR6LCBKdWxpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Steitz, Julia'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Animal models in preclinical metastatic breast cancer immunotherapy research: A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy outcomes'],2025-05-08T13:36:53.583+0200,337.0

We interrogated the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, from which individual-level data on dietary intake of vitamin A were garnered from 13,909 adolescents (aged 10–19\u2009years) participating in the 1999–2018 study cycle. After dividing vitamin A intake into four quartiles, we leveraged weighted multivariate logistic regression to investigate the association of vitamin A intake with hypertension by each quartile, with the restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve plotted to assess the nonlinearity of association. Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis to examine whether gender remarkably affects vitamin A's effect on hypertension. Of all the adolescent participants, 1477 (10.6%) were found to have hypertension. Following thorough adjustments for confounding factors, per 1-SD increment in vitamin A intake was associated with a 23%, 26%, and 31% reduction in the risk of hypertension for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles, respectively. Consistently, the RCS curve indicated that the risk of adolescent hypertension presented a decreasing trend as vitamin A intake creeped up. Intriguingly, gender-stratified subgroup analysis demonstrated that the observed association between vitamin A and adolescent hypertension was more pronounced in boys. Together, our findings outlined vitamin A as a protective dietary factor against hypertension among US adolescents.

The protective capability of various combinations of hydro-alcoholic extracts (HAEs) of ginger, turmeric, and Shirazi thyme, against the toxicity of AFB1 on the RAW264.7 cell line was investigated. The RAW264.7 cells were exposed to six different concentrations of AFB1 (0.09, 0.18, 0.37, 0.75, 1.5, and 3\u2009μg mL−1) for 48\u2009h to determine the IC50 of AFB1. AFB1 was estimated to have an IC50 of 1.5\u2009μg mL−1 for RAW264.7 cells. Then, the cells were simultaneously incubated with 1.5\u2009μg mL−1 AFB1 and the HAEs for 24\u2009h. The HAEs significantly reduced the toxicity of AFB1 in RAW264.7 cells. HAE of Shirazi thyme showed the highest amount of total phenol content (TPC) and the highest DPPH• activity. In addition, a combination of ginger, turmeric, and Shirazi thyme extract showed the highest antioxidant activity. Rutin, quercetin, and apigenin were the main phenolic components of ginger HAE. A significantly positive correlation was observed between TPC of hydro-alcoholic extract with ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) values.

Risk prediction tools have a potential role in prevention and early detection. METHODS: The IARC-ARCAGE European case–control study was used as the model development dataset. A clinical HNC risk prediction model using behavioral and demographic predictors was developed via multivariable logistic regression analyses. The model was then externally validated in the UK Biobank cohort. Model performance was tested using discrimination and calibration metrics. RESULTS: 1926 HNC cases and 2043 controls were used for the development of the model. The development dataset model including sociodemographic, smoking, and alcohol variables had moderate discrimination, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.74–0.77); the calibration slope (0.75) and tests were suggestive of good calibration. 384\u2009616 UK Biobank participants (with 1177 HNC cases) were available for external validation of the model. Upon external validation, the model had an AUC of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.61–0.64). CONCLUSION: We developed and externally validated a HNC risk prediction model using the ARCAGE and UK Biobank studies, respectively. This model had moderate performance in the development population and acceptable performance in the validation dataset. Demographics and risk behaviors are strong predictors of HNC, and this model may be a helpful tool in primary dental care settings to promote prevention and determine recall intervals for dental examination.

However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems. METHODS: Through a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5258 abstracts and identified 36 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps. RESULTS: No regional convergence was found across foci of treatment-associated alterations in functional imaging. Subgroup analysis in the Treated > Untreated contrast revealed a convergent cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of the treatment-associated alterations in a circuit more prominent in the frontoparietal areas. This circuit was co-aligned with circuits targeted by ""anti-subgenual"" and ""Beam F3"" transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters.\r\nCONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of the frontoparietal network and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants, which may relate to their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.

frl:6511198,"[""Subanesthetic doses of ketamine induce an antidepressant effect within hours in individuals with treatment-resistant depression while it furthermore induces immediate but transient psychotomimetic effects. Among these psychotomimetic effects, an altered sense of self has specifically been associated with the antidepressant response to ketamine as well as psychedelics. However, there is plenty of variation in the extent of the drug-induced altered sense of self experience that might be explained by differences in basal morphological characteristics, such as cortical thickness. Regions that have been previously associated with a psychedelics-induced sense of self and with ketamine's mechanism of action, are the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over magnetic resonance imaging study, thirty-five healthy male participants (mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 25.1 ± 4.2 years) were scanned at 7 T. We investigated whether the cortical thickness of two DMN regions, the PCC and the pgACC, are associated with disembodiment and experience of unity scores, which were used to index the ketamine-induced altered sense of self. We observed a negative correlation between the PCC cortical thickness and the disembodiment scores (R = -0.54, p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant association was found between the pgACC cortical thickness and the ketamine-induced altered sense of self. In the context of the existing literature, our findings highlight the importance of the PCC as a structure involved in the mechanism of ketamine-induced altered sense of self that seems to be shared with different antidepressant agents with psychotomimetic effects operating on different classes of transmitter systems.

Bioinformatics analyses revealed that C16orf74 is significantly overexpressed in HNSC and is associated with advanced disease stages, therapy resistance, and shorter overall and progression-free survival. A prognostic nomogram integrating C16orf74 expression with clinicopathological features demonstrated robust predictive performance. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses suggest that high C16orf74 expression might contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing key immune cell populations, such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells, which are critical for anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, C16orf74 expression was inversely associated with immune checkpoint expression and immunotherapy response, highlighting its potential as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy. Drug sensitivity analyses identified potential therapeutic agents, including arsenic trioxide, carmustine, vincristine, quercetin, and carboplatin for patients with high C16orf74 expression.

frl:6509984,"['BACKGROUND: The prevalence of metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rising precipitously among children, particularly in regions or countries burdened with high prevalence of obesity. However, identifying those at high risk remains a significant challenge, as the majority do not exhibit distinct symptoms of MASLD. There is an urgent need for a widely accepted non-invasive predictor to facilitate early disease diagnosis and management of the disease. Our study aims to 1) evaluate and compare existing predictors of MASLD, and 2) develop a practical screening strategy for children, tailored to local prevalence of obesity. METHODS: We utilized a school-based cross-sectional survey in Beijing as the training dataset to establish predictive models for screening MASLD in children. An independent school-based study in Ningbo was used to validate the models. We selected the optimal non-invasive MASLD predictor by comparing logistic regression model, random forest model, decision tree model, and support vector machine model using both the Beijing and Ningbo datasets. This was followed by serial testing using the best performance index we identified and indices from previous studies. Finally, we calculated the potential MASLD screening recommendation categories and corresponding profits based on national and subnational obesity prevalence, and applied those three categories to 200 countries according to their obesity prevalence from 1990 to 2022. FINDINGS: A total of 1018 children were included (NBeijing = 596, NNingbo = 422). The logistic regression model demonstrated the best performance, identifying the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, cutoff value ≥0.48) as the optimal noninvasive index for predicting MASLD, with strong performance in both training and validation set. Additionally, the combination of WHtR and lipid accumulation product (LAP) was selected as an optimal serial test to improve the positive predictive value, with a LAP cutoff value of ≥668.22 cm × mg/dL. Based on the obesity prevalence among 30 provinces, three MASLD screening recommendations were proposed: 1) “Population-screening-recommended”: For regions with an obesity prevalence ≥12.0%, where MASLD prevalence ranged from 5.0% to 21.5%; 2) “Resources-permitted”: For regions with an obesity prevalence between 8.4% and 12.0%, where MASLD prevalence ranged from 2.3% to 4.4%; 3) “Population-screening-not-recommended”: For regions with an obesity prevalence <8.4%, where MASLD prevalence is difficult to detect using our tool. Using our proposed cutoff for screening MASLD, the number of countries classified into the “Population-screening-recommended” and “Resources-permitted” categories increased from one and 11 in 1990 to 95 and 28 in 2022, respectively. INTERPRETATION: WHtR might serve as a practical and accessible index for predicting pediatric MASLD. A WHtR value ≥0.48 could facilitate early identification and management of MASLD in areas with obesity prevalence ≥12.0%. Furthermore, combining WHtR ≥0.48 with LAP ≥668.22 cm × mg/dL is recommended for individual MASLD screening. Moreover, linking these measures with population obesity prevalence not only helps estimate MASLD prevalence but also indicates potential screening profits in regions at varying levels of obesity risk.']",public,['49:101150'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2451-4316', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Yunfei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWW91eGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Youxin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGluZywgWXVuZmVp', 'prefLabel': 'Xing, Yunfei'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-2141', 'prefLabel': 'Wolters, Maike'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpLCBEaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Shi, Di'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFBpbmdwaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Pingping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFuZywgSmlhamlh', 'prefLabel': 'Dang, Jiajia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgWml5dWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Ziyue'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FpLCBTaGFu', 'prefLabel': 'Cai, Shan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWWFnaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Yagi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKaWV5ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jieye'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWGlueGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Xinxin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvdSwgSGFveXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Haoyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIE1pYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Miao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBMaXBv', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Lipo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFl1YW55dWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yuanyuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29uZywgSmlleXVu', 'prefLabel': 'Song, Jieyun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIEppbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Jing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9uZywgWWFuaHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Dong, Yanhui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3VpLCBZYW5jaHVu', 'prefLabel': 'Cui, Yanchun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIFBlaWppbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Peijin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-5958', 'prefLabel': 'Hebestreit, Antje'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgSGFpLWp1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Hai-jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIExp', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Li'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIEp1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWVvLCBZZWUtSHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Yeo, Yee-Hui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgSHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Hui'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6990-6781', 'prefLabel': 'Song, Yi'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Establish a noninvasive model to screen metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children aged 6–14 years in China and its applications in high-obesity-risk countries and regions'],2025-02-07T11:08:09.770+0100,266.0

A transient co-transfection reporter gene assay on HepG2 cells was also used to verify the role of PXR in regulating CYP3A4 expression. Our results showed that tea polyphenols from KBT significantly induced the expression of CYP 3A11 and PXR in general, inhibited the expression of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1 in general, and significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of Cyp2c37 but induced its protein expression.

We aimed to investigate how the chromosomal location affects epigenetic stability and gene expression by chromosome engineering. Two chromosomal inversions of different sizes were induced using CRISPR/Cas9 to move heterochromatic, pericentric sequences into euchromatic regions. The epigenetic status of these lines was investigated using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Gene expression changes following the induction of the chromosomal inversions were studied via transcriptome analysis. Both inversions had a minimal impact on the global distribution of histone marks and DNA methylation patterns, although minor epigenetic changes were observed across the genome. Notably, the inverted chromosomal regions and their borders retained their original epigenetic profiles. Gene expression analysis showed that only 0.5–1% of genes were differentially expressed genome-wide following the induction of the inversions. CRISPR/Cas-induced chromosomal inversions minimally affect epigenetic landscape and gene expression, preserving their profiles in subsequent generations.']",public,['245(6):2527-2539'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7781-1085', 'prefLabel': 'Khosravi, Solmaz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-5167-8232', 'prefLabel': 'Hinrichs, Rebecca'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2659-6829', 'prefLabel': 'Rönspies, Michelle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9143-4319', 'prefLabel': 'Haghi Darehdeh, Reza'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1073-8546', 'prefLabel': 'Puchta, Holger'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3419-239X', 'prefLabel': 'Houben, Andreas'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Epigenetic state and gene expression remain stable after CRISPR/Cas-mediated chromosomal inversions'],2025-04-10T11:03:40.528+0200,325.0

The pH and melting rate values of the samples decreased with the addition of mint flavor, while acidity values increased. The addition of mint aroma caused significant changes in the thermal properties of ice cream. The overrun, a*, WI, and hardness values of the samples decreased based on the mint flavor concentration, whereas the viscosity and rheological increased.

The leaching percentages of mineral elements and the effect of boiling time on the transfer of elements to aqueous extracts were also determined. In terms of fatty acids profile, the robusta variety was found to have a higher content of saturated fatty acids (46.68%) compared to the arabica variety (44.38%), whereas arabica contained a higher amount of omega-6. Regarding the volatile compounds, arabica contained higher amounts of pyrazines (36%), ketones (5.4%), and furans (37.8%).

METHODS: Fruit and vegetable consumptions in relation to BC risk was examined by pooling individual participant data from case–control studies. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate study-specific odds ratio’s (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and combined using a random-effects model for intakes of total fruits, total vegetables, and subgroups of fruits and vegetables. RESULTS: A total of 11 case–control studies were included, comprising 5637 BC cases and 10,504 controls. Overall, participants with the highest intakes versus the lowest intakes of fruits in total (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68–0.91), citrus fruits (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.65–0.98), pome fruits (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65–0.87), and tropical fruits (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73–0.94) reduced the BC risk. Greater consumption of vegetables in total, and specifically shoot vegetables, was associated with decreased BC risk (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68–0.96 and OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78–0.96, respectively). Substantial heterogeneity was observed for the associations between citrus fruits and total vegetables and BC risk.

While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or groups of chromosomes, they show a longitudinal distribution and broad intergenic binding on the X chromosome, which partially recapitulates phenotypes known from holocentric species. Despite this variable CenH3 distribution among chromosomes, all chromosomes are functionally monocentric, marking the first instance of a monocentric species with chromosome-wide CenH3 deposition. Together, our findings illustrate a potential transitional state between mono- and holocentricity or toward CenH3-independent centromere determination and help to understand the rapid centromere sequence divergence between species.']",public,['11(1):eads6459'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG91YmlhbmEsIFdpbGxpYW0=', 'prefLabel': 'Toubiana, William'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHVtYXMsIFpvw6k=', 'prefLabel': 'Dumas, Zoé'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFuLCBQYXRyaWNrIFRyYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Van, Patrick Tran'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFya2VyLCBEYXJyZW4gSg==', 'prefLabel': 'Parker, Darren J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcOpcmVsLCBWaW5jZW50IA==', 'prefLabel': 'Mérel, Vincent '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3072-0485', 'prefLabel': 'Schubert, Veit'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXVyeSwgSmVhbi1NYXJj', 'prefLabel': 'Aury, Jean-Marc'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm91cm5vbnZpbGxlLCBMb3LDqG5l', 'prefLabel': 'Bournonville, Lorène'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3J1YXVkLCBDb3Jpbm5lIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Cruaud, Corinne '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3419-239X', 'prefLabel': 'Houben, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXN0YWNlLCBCZW5qYW1pbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Istace, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFiYWRpZSwgS2FyaW5lIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Labadie, Karine '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tm9lbCwgQmVuamFtaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Noel, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Nod2FuZGVyLCBUYW5qYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Schwander, Tanja'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Functional monocentricity with holocentric characteristics and chromosome-specific centromeres in a stick insect'],2025-04-11T10:42:00.424+0200,325.0

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L) is considered one of the most drought-stress-tolerant cereals and may be used for elucidating genes for drought tolerance at seed germination and seedling stages that would pave the way toward improving the performance of all cereals. The current study was performed at IPK-Gatersleben (Germany) in 2023. Our aim was to explore the genetic basis of germination and seedling traits under drought stress (20% PEG(6000) treatment) in a 198 global spring barley collection genotyped with 38,632 SNPs via Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS). The drought treatment significantly reduced the seed germination parameters and seedling traits in the genotypes of a global barley collection. Drought tolerance indices (DTI) for the measured germination and seedling traits indicate delayed and lower germination speed under drought stress than the control. The shoot fresh weight was the most affected trait, with a DTI of 37.4, followed by the seedling fresh weight SDLFW (DTI = 46.3) and root fresh weight (DTI = 47). In contrast, the root length DTI was the least affected trait by drought (78.2), followed by RDW DTI (72.8). GWAS was conducted using single-locus (CMLM) and multi-locus models (MLMM, Farm-CPU, BLINK), with significant marker-trait associations determined at -log10 (1.29E(-06)) >/= 5.88. In our present study, we identified 79 highly significant SNPs distributed across the seven barley chromosomes related to the germination and seedling growth parameters under both control and drought conditions. Gene annotation of these highly significant SNPs revealed that 35 SNPs were in the exonic regions of genes that play roles in important plant biological and physiological processes. Further analysis exhibited 35 high-confidence candidate genes influencing barley germination and seedling growth under control and drought conditions. These genes represent promising targets for breeding and genetic enhancement efforts to improve drought tolerance in barley, potentially extending these benefits to other cereal crops.']",public,['15(1):10085'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFkciwgQWJkZWxmYXR0YWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Badr, Abdelfattah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWwtU2hhemx5LCBIYW5hYSBI', 'prefLabel': 'El-Shazly, Hanaa H'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFoZHksIE1heWFkYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mahdy, Mayada'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4847-4059', 'prefLabel': 'Schierenbeck, Matías'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbWksIFJhZHdhIFkg', 'prefLabel': 'Helmi, Radwa Y '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Börner, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4957-4040', 'prefLabel': 'Youssef, Helmy'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['GWAS identifies novel loci linked to seedling growth traits in highly diverse barley population under drought stress'],2025-06-03T11:54:55.431+0200,325.0

We examined the association between BMI and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) within and across populations of different world regions and quantified how well these two metrics discriminate between people with and without hypertension. METHODS: We used data from studies carried out from 1990 to 2023 on BMI, WHtR and hypertension in people aged 20–64 years in representative samples of the general population in eight world regions. We graphically compared the regional distributions of BMI and WHtR, and calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients between BMI and WHtR within each region. We used mixed-effects linear regression to estimate the extent to which WHtR varies across regions at the same BMI. We graphically examined the prevalence of hypertension and the distribution of people who have hypertension both in relation to BMI and WHtR, and we assessed how closely BMI and WHtR discriminate between participants with and without hypertension using C-statistic and net reclassification improvement (NRI). FINDINGS: The correlation between BMI and WHtR ranged from 0·76 to 0·89 within different regions. After adjusting for age and BMI, mean WHtR was highest in south Asia for both sexes, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. Mean WHtR was lowest in central and eastern Europe for both sexes, in the high-income western region for women, and in Oceania for men. Conversely, to achieve an equivalent WHtR, the BMI of the population of south Asia would need to be, on average, 2·79 kg/m2 (95% CI 2·31–3·28) lower for women and 1·28 kg/m2 (1·02–1·54) lower for men than in the high-income western region. In every region, hypertension prevalence increased with both BMI and WHtR. Models with either of these two adiposity metrics had virtually identical C-statistics and NRIs for every region and sex, with C-statistics ranging from 0·72 to 0·81 and NRIs ranging from 0·34 to 0·57 in different region and sex combinations. When both BMI and WHtR were used, performance improved only slightly compared with using either adiposity measure alone. INTERPRETATION: BMI can distinguish young and middle-aged adults with higher versus lower amounts of abdominal adiposity with moderate-to-high accuracy, and both BMI and WHtR distinguish people with or without hypertension. However, at the same BMI level, people in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa, have higher WHtR than in the other regions.""]",public,['404(10455):851-863'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TkNEIFJpc2sgRmFjdG9yIENvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24=', 'prefLabel': 'NCD Risk Factor Collaboration'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['General and abdominal adiposity and hypertension in eight world regions: a pooled analysis of 837 population-based studies with 7·5 million participants'],2025-02-12T12:26:32.727+0100,266.0

In Experiment 1, we recruited 185 online participants across the mental imagery spectrum, including individuals with self-reported aphantasia (impoverished or absent mental imagery) and hyperphantasia (extremely vivid imagery). In Experiment 2, we recruited 56 participants, 28 with self-reported aphantasia and 28 gender- and age-matched typical imagers. Consistent with the original 2007 study\'s interpretation, we predicted that those with more vivid imagery would exhibit stronger imagery-perception interference, as measured by decreased performance in a priming task when a color and word were congruent (e.g., red prime, word ""RED"") compared to incongruent (e.g., blue prime, word ""RED""). We were unable to replicate this effect in either experiment. Instead, we observed performance benefits for color-word congruency across the mental imagery spectrum, with no difference in the magnitude of this effect across imagery ability or vividness, even among those with extreme imagery variations (aphantasia, hyperphantasia). Interestingly, we observed a relationship between a measure of mental imagery externalism and the congruency effect, suggesting that individuals with the ability to project their mental images into the external environment (i.e., prophantasia) may exhibit stronger congruency effects.

frl:6489617,"['Adaptation is the attenuation of a neuronal response when a stimulus is repeatedly presented. The phenomenon has been linked to sensory memory, but its exact neuronal mechanisms are under debate. One defining feature of adaptation is its lifetime, that is, the timespan over which the attenuating effect of previous stimulation persists. This can be revealed by varying the stimulus-onset interval (SOI) of the repeated stimulus. As SOI is increased, the peak amplitude of the response grows before saturating at large SOIs. The rate of this growth can be quantified and used as an estimate of adaptation lifetime. Here, we studied whether adaptation lifetime varies across the left and the right auditory cortex of the human brain. Event-related fields of whole-head magnetoencephalograms (MEG) were measured in 14 subjects during binaural presentation of pure tone stimuli. To make statistical inferences on the single-subject level, additional event-related fields were generated by resampling the original single-trial data via bootstrapping. For each hemisphere and SOI, the peak amplitude of the N1m response was then derived from both original and bootstrap-based data sets. Finally, the N1m-peak amplitudes were used for deriving subject- and hemisphere-specific estimates of adaptation lifetime. Comparing subject-specific adaptation lifetime across hemispheres, we found a significant difference, with longer adaptation lifetimes in the left than in the right auditory cortex (p = 0.004). This difference might have a functional relevance in the context of temporal binding of auditory stimuli, leading to larger integration time windows in the left than in the right hemisphere.

Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is a valuable natural food pigment that has been reported to have significant health-promoting abilities. However, the anti-AS efficacy and mechanisms of HSYA have not yet been characterized. Here, we found that treatment of apolipoprotein A (ApoE) knockout (ApoE−/−) mice with HSYA markedly ameliorated atherosclerosis evidenced by decreased levels of lipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial permeability, and endothelial damage. Moreover, mechanistic studies revealed that HSYA treatment downregulated the expression of aortic sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK), and filamentous actin (F-actin). The results of administration with HSYA reversed the effects of SphK1 agonist and S1PR3 agonist on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced vascular endothelial cell migration ability and F-actin expression, and decreased RhoA/ROCK protein expression further confirmed the conclusion that HSYA reduced vascular endothelial permeability by modulating the SphK1/S1P/S1PR3/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, thereby exerting anti-atherosclerotic effects.

However, the highest total phenolic content (TPC) (138.35\u2009±\u20090.63\u2009mg GAE per gram of dried GOEs) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (189.12\u2009±\u20091.47\u2009mg catechin per gram of dried GOEs) were extracted using A90 (acetone–water, 90:10) solvent. A90 extract exhibited the highest inhibition of sucrase activity (91.42%) (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Also, the inhibitory activity of A90 against α-amylase (59.96%), α-glucosidase (54.3%), and maltase (62.73%) was significantly higher than that of A70 (acetone–water, 70:30) and E20 (ethanol–water, 20:80) (p\u2009<\u2009.05).

frl:6510164,"['BACKGROUND: For over three decades, the concomitance of cortical neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) has sparked discussions about their coupled temporal dynamics. Longitudinal studies supporting this hypothesis nonetheless remain scarce. METHODS: We applied global and regional bivariate latent growth curve modelling to determine the extent to which WMH and cortical thickness were interrelated over a four-year period. For this purpose, we leveraged longitudinal MRI data from 451 cognitively unimpaired participants (DELCODE; median age 69.71 [IQR 65.51, 75.50] years; 52.32% female). Participants underwent MRI sessions annually over a four-year period (1815 sessions in total, with roughly four MRI sessions per participant). We adjusted all models for demographics and cardiovascular risk. RESUILTS: Our findings were three-fold. First, larger WMH volumes were linked to lower cortical thickness (σ = -0.165, SE = 0.047, Z = -3.515, P < 0.001). Second, individuals with higher WMH volumes experienced more rapid cortical thinning (σ = -0.226, SE = 0.093, Z = -2.443, P = 0.007), particularly in temporal, cingulate, and insular regions. Similarly, those with lower initial cortical thickness had faster WMH progression (σ = -0.141, SE = 0.060, Z = -2.336, P = 0.009), with this effect being most pronounced in temporal, cingulate, and insular cortices. Third, faster WMH progression was associated with accelerated cortical thinning (σ = -0.239, SE = 0.139, Z = -1.710, P = 0.044), particularly in frontal, occipital, and insular cortical regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that cortical thinning and WMH progression could be mutually reinforcing rather than parallel, unrelated processes, which become entangled before cognitive deficits are detectable.

Currently, there is a paucity of information on how and when lithium is used by pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: To examine lithium use in the perinatal period. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used individual-level data of pregnancies from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2021, in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and 2 cohorts in the US. Analyses were performed from September 1 to November 30, 2023. EXPOSURES: The prevalence of lithium use as the proportion of pregnancies with at least 1 prescription fill or prescription within 3 months before pregnancy until childbirth was estimated using a common protocol. Lithium use during pregnancy by trimester and in the 3 months before and after pregnancy was examined. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Comparison of prevalence between the first and last 3-year periods of available data. RESULTS: Among 21\u202f659\u202f454 pregnancies from all collaborating sites, the prevalence of lithium use ranged from 0.07 per 1000 pregnancies in Hong Kong to 1.56 per 1000 in the US publicly insured population. Lithium use increased per 1000 pregnancies in 10 populations (Australia [0.60 to 0.74], Denmark [0.09 to 0.51], Finland [0.10 to 0.29], Iceland [0.24 to 0.99], Israel [0.25 to 0.37], Norway [0.24 to 0.47], South Korea [0.30 to 0.44], Sweden [0.42 to 1.07], the UK [0.07 to 0.10], and Taiwan [0.15 to 0.19]), remained stable in 4 populations (Germany [0.17 to 0.16], Hong Kong [0.06 to 0.06], and the publicly [1.50 to 1.34] and commercially [0.38 to 0.36] insured US populations), and decreased in 1 population (New Zealand [0.54 to 0.39]). Use of lithium decreased with each trimester of pregnancy, while prevalence of postpartum use was similar to prepregnancy levels. The proportion of lithium use in the second trimester compared with the prepregnancy period ranged from 2% in South Korea to 80% in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prevalence of lithium use in pregnant women over the past 2 decades varied markedly between populations. Patterns of use before, during, and after pregnancy suggest that many women discontinued lithium use during pregnancy and reinitiated treatment after childbirth, with large variations between countries. These findings underscore the need for internationally harmonized guidelines, specifically for psychiatric conditions among pregnant women that may benefit from lithium treatment.']",public,['7(12):e2451117'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2l0dHN0csO2bSwgRmVsaXg=', 'prefLabel': 'Wittström, Felix'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2VzdGEsIENhcm9seW4gRS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Cesta, Carolyn E.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmF0ZW1hbiwgQnJpYW4gVC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bateman, Brian T.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVuZGl4LCBNYXJpZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Bendix, Marie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmxpZGRhbCwgTWV0dGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bliddal, Mette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhbiwgQWRyaWVubmUgWS4gTC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Chan, Adrienne Y.

frl:6511004,"['The tetraploid genome and clonal propagation of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)(1,2) dictate a slow, non-accumulative breeding mode of the most important tuber crop. Transitioning potato breeding to a seed-propagated hybrid system based on diploid inbred lines has the potential to greatly accelerate its improvement(3). Crucially, the development of inbred lines is impeded by manifold deleterious variants; explaining their nature and finding ways to eliminate them is the current focus of hybrid potato research(4-10). However, most published diploid potato genomes are unphased, concealing crucial information on haplotype diversity and heterozygosity(11-13). Here we develop a phased potato pangenome graph of 60 haplotypes from cultivated diploids and the ancestral wild species, and find evidence for the prevalence of transposable elements in generating structural variants. Compared with the linear reference, the graph pangenome represents a broader diversity (3,076 Mb versus 742 Mb). Notably, we observe enhanced heterozygosity in cultivated diploids compared with wild ones (14.0% versus 9.5%), indicating extensive hybridization during potato domestication. Using conservative criteria, we identify 19,625 putatively deleterious structural variants (dSVs) and reveal a biased accumulation of deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (dSNPs) around dSVs in coupling phase. Based on the graph pangenome, we computationally design ideal potato haplotypes with minimal dSNPs and dSVs. These advances provide critical insights into the genomic basis of clonal propagation and will guide breeders to develop a suite of promising inbred lines.']",public,['640(8058):408-417'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbmcsIExpbiA=', 'prefLabel': 'Cheng, Lin '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgTmFu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Nan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3601-460X', 'prefLabel': 'Bao, Zhigui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvdSwgUWlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Qian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9744-131X', 'prefLabel': 'Guarracino, Andrea'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgWXV0aW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Yuting'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgUGVp', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Pei'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-9439', 'prefLabel': 'zhang, zhiyang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuZywgRGll', 'prefLabel': 'Tang, Die'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6305-1006', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Pingxian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFlhb3lhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Yaoyao'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9791-7664', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Yao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhlbmcsIFlpIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Zheng, Yi '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIFlvbmcg', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Yong '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlhbiwgUXVuIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Lian, Qun '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-4787-2329', 'prefLabel': 'ma, zhaoxu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFzc29pcywgTHVkaXZpbmUg', 'prefLabel': 'Lassois, Ludivine '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIENodW56aGkg', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Chunzhi '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVjYXMsIFdpbGxpYW0gSg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lucas, William J'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3821-631X', 'prefLabel': 'Garrison, Erik'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-8731', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Nils'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3TDpGRsZXIsIFRob21hcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Städler, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0780-2973', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Yongfeng'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8547-5309', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Sanwen'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Leveraging a phased pangenome for haplotype design of hybrid potato'],2025-04-11T14:51:16.341+0200,325.0

We also replicated the differential connectivity of magnocellular and parvocellular LGN compartments with V1 across visual field positions.

Furthermore, tractography based on in vivo dMRI data from the same macaque brains acquired at standard field strength (3T) yielded comparable topographic maps in many cases.

The expression level and clinical significance of SH3D21 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, the relationship between SH3D21 and the features of tumor microenvironment (TME) and role of SH3D21 in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression were analyzed based on the bulk samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases.

Additionally, different biological effects of SH3D21 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells were investigated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, colony forming assay and Western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments revealed that the expression level of SH3D21 was up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and correlated with the poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. SH3D21 effectively promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration as well as the formation of immunosuppressive microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, SH3D21 can activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

frl:6489496,"['BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) is considered a protective factor for cognitive function and may explain interindividual differences of cognitive performance given similar levels of neurodegeneration, e.g., in Alzheimer´s disease. Recent evidence suggests that CR is also relevant in Parkinson’s disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the role of life-stage specific CR for overall cognition and specific cognitive domains cross-sectionally and longitudinally in PD. METHODS: The cross-sectional analysis with data from the DEMPARK/LANDSCAPE study included 81 individuals without cognitive impairment (PD-N) and 87 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Longitudinal data covered 4 years with over 500 observations. CR was operationalized with the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ), capturing the complexity of lifestyle activities across distinct life-stages. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: Higher LEQ scores, particularly from mid- and late-life, were observed in PD-N compared to PD-MCI [F(1,153)\u2009=\u20094.609, p\u2009=\u2009.033, ηp2\u2009=\u20090.029]. They were significantly associated with better cognitive performance (0.200\u2009≤\u2009β\u2009≤\u20090.292). Longitudinally, linear mixed effect models (0.236\u2009≤\u2009marginal R2\u2009≤\u20090.441) revealed that LEQ scores were positively related to cognitive performance independent of time. However, the decline in overall cognition and memory over time was slightly more pronounced with higher LEQ scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the association between complex lifestyle activities and cognition in PD. Data indicate that while CR might be related to a delay of cognitive decline, individuals with high CR may experience a more pronounced drop in overall cognition and memory. Future studies will have to replicate these findings, particularly regarding domain-specific effects and considering reverse causal mechanisms.']",public,['271(8):5411-5424'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5858-7762', 'prefLabel': 'Ophey, Anja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lydHosIEthdGhyaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wirtz, Kathrin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29sZnNncnViZXIsIFN0ZWZmZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wolfsgruber, Steffen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFsemVyLUdlbGRzZXR6ZXIsIE1vbmlrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Balzer-Geldsetzer, Monika'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5796-5442', 'prefLabel': 'Berg, Daniela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlsa2VyLVJvZ2dlbmRvcmYsIFLDvGRpZ2Vy', 'prefLabel': 'Hilker-Roggendorf, Rüdiger'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7106-9270', 'prefLabel': 'Kassubek, Jan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0875-892X', 'prefLabel': 'Liepelt-Scarfone, Inga'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4595-580X', 'prefLabel': 'Becker, Sara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9sbGVuaGF1ZXIsIEJyaXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Mollenhauer, Brit'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9730-9228', 'prefLabel': 'Reetz, Kathrin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1721-502X', 'prefLabel': 'Riedel, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8903-0593', 'prefLabel': 'Schulz, Jörg B.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of patients aged ≥ 40 years who had been exposed to roflumilast and a matched cohort unexposed to roflumilast. The matching was based on sex, age, calendar year of cohort entry date (2010– 2011, 2012, or 2013), and a propensity score that included variables such as demographics, markers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity and morbidity, and comorbidities. In comparison to the unexposed matched cohort (never use), three exposure definitions were used for the exposed matched cohort: ever use, use status (current, recent, past use), and cumulative duration of use. The main outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality. Cox regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: 112,541 unexposed and 23,239 exposed patients across countries were included. Some variables remained unbalanced after matching, indicating higher COPD disease severity among the exposed patients. Adjusted HRs of 5-year all-cause mortality for “ever use” of roflumilast, compared to “never use”, were 1.12 (95% CI, 1.08– 1.17) in Germany, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92– 1.08) in Norway, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92– 1.04) in Sweden, and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.12– 1.20) in the US. Compared to never users, there was a decrease in 5-year mortality risk observed among “current users” in Germany (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88– 0.98), Norway (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67– 0.87), and Sweden (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73– 0.88). CONCLUSION: There was no observed increase in 5-year mortality risk with the use of roflumilast in Sweden or Norway. A small increase in 5-year mortality risk was observed in Germany and the US in the ever versus never comparison, likely due to residual confounding by indication.']",public,['19:1879-1892'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5408-1462', 'prefLabel': 'Garbe, Edeltraut'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7464-3549', 'prefLabel': 'Hoti, Fabian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0224-1866', 'prefLabel': 'Schink, Tania'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3ZlbmRzZW4sIEtyaXN0aWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Svendsen, Kristian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwtRWlkLCBIYXlkYXIgTS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Al-Eid, Haydar M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJraGFtbWVyLCBQZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Arkhammer, Per'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FybGhvbG0sIE1hcmll', 'prefLabel': 'Carlholm, Marie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-9064-0582', 'prefLabel': 'Fjällbrant, Harald'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJhbnrDqW4sIFN0ZWZhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Franzén, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVkbHVuZCwgQ2VjaWxpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hedlund, Cecilia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5964-954X', 'prefLabel': 'Kollhorst, Bianca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VtYXIsIEF0dWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Kumar, Atul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG9iaWVyLCBNdXJpZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Lobier, Muriel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVzaG5pa292LCBWYXNpbGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Mushnikov, Vasili'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVyc3NvbiwgVG9yZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Persson, Tore'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2724-9909', 'prefLabel': 'Qiao, Xu'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6698-6093', 'prefLabel': 'Salosensaari, Aaro'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8284-448X', 'prefLabel': 'Schäfer, Wiebke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2ljaWduYW5vLCBOaWNob2xhcyBNLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Sicignano, Nicholas M.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9351-3881', 'prefLabel': 'Johansson, Gunnar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0802-419X', 'prefLabel': 'Dareng, Eileen'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Long-Term Safety of Roflumilast in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, a Multinational Observational Database Cohort Study']",2025-03-18T10:48:25.906+0100,266.0

A biomarker of bone formation (serum osteocalcin), a biomarker of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen [CTx]), and stiffness index measured using calcaneal quantitative ultrasound were considered outcomes. Linear mixed-effects models were used to adjust for confounders (i.e., age, sex, parental education, time spent in sports club, dairy products consumption, sedentary behavior, height and weight z-scores), the cluster effect of country and repeated measurements. Interactions of calcium intake, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and weight status with 25(OH)D on outcomes were tested. Only 1 in 3 participants reached the sufficient 25(OH) D concentration of 20 ng/mL. Sufficient 25(OH)D was associated with higher stiffness index if participants had MVPA ≥60 min/day (β = 12.14, P < .05). Moreover, 25(OH)D was inversely associated with CTx (β = –7.09, P < .05); this association was positive but not statistically significant among primary school children living with overweight/obesity. No interaction was observed for calcium intake. In conclusion, serum 25(OH)D and CTx were inversely associated.

Copper and cadmium are two significant heavy metals that have become more concentrated in many soils. These metals are taken up by many plants, including wheat, and can cause various diseases in humans. The most effective way to mitigate the harmful effects of heavy metals is to grow tolerant wheat genotypes. In the current study, two different pot experiments were conducted to understand the genetic control of copper and cadmium tolerance in wheat seedlings. Two populations were used in this study, consisting of 92 genotypes for the copper experiment and 73 genotypes for the cadmium experiment. In both experiments, a replicated complete block design with three replications was used. Highly significant differences were found between the tested genotypes for all studied traits in both metals, except for root weight and the ratio between shoot weight and root weight under cadmium contamination. Single-marker analysis was performed for all significant traits, and a total of 265 and 381 markers were found to be significantly associated with seedling traits under copper and cadmium conditions, respectively. Of these markers, only eight were commonly associated with the tolerance to both metals. These markers were located within five different gene models that were functionally annotated to control heavy metal tolerance. Gene enrichment of the five identified genes revealed two key genes that significantly influenced eight biological processes, six molecular functions, and three Kyoto Ecyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in heavy metal tolerance. The sources of the eight markers and their associated genes were identified in twelve genotypes, including one Egyptian and one Kazakhstani genotype, which showed superior responses to copper and cadmium, respectively.

This study includes an embedded mixed-methods process evaluation. People with MS, aged 18–65 years, in paid employment will be recruited from MS charities. Participants with MS will be able to include their employers in the intervention to receive information about MS and employment. The intervention involves an initial interview and up to 10 hours of employment support for people with MS and up to four hours of support for employers, over six months. Employees from MS charities will be recruited and trained to deliver the MSVR intervention.

This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism by which HFD affects IBD using 16S rRNA-sequencing and RNA-seq technology. Results indicated that HFD-treated mice exhibited notable alternations in the structure and composition of the gut microbiota, with some of these alternations being associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the colon transcriptome revealed 11 hub genes and 7 hub pathways among control, DSS-induced colitis, and HFD\u2009+\u2009DSS-treated groups. Further analysis explores the relationship between the hub pathways and genes, as well as the hub genes and gut microbiota. Overall, the findings indicate that the impact of HFD on DSS-induced colitis may be linked to intestinal dysbiosis and specific genes such as Abca8b, Ace2, Apoa1, Apoa4, Apoc3, Aspa, Dpp4, Maob, Slc34a2, Slc7a9, and Trpm6.

Here we report a root angle regulatory gene termed ENHANCED GRAVITROPISM1 (EGT1) that encodes a putative AGO component, whose loss-of-function enhances root gravitropism. Mutations in barley and wheat EGT1 genes confer a striking root phenotype, where every root class adopts a steeper growth angle. EGT1 encodes an F-box and Tubby domain-containing protein that is highly conserved across plant species. Haplotype analysis found that natural allelic variation at the barley EGT1 locus impacts root angle. Gravitropic assays indicated that Hvegt1 roots bend more rapidly than wild-type. Transcript profiling revealed Hvegt1 roots deregulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and cell wall-loosening enzymes and cofactors. ROS imaging shows that Hvegt1 root basal meristem and elongation zone tissues have reduced levels. Atomic force microscopy measurements detected elongating Hvegt1 root cortical cell walls are significantly less stiff than wild-type. In situ analysis identified HvEGT1 is expressed in elongating cortical and stele tissues, which are distinct from known root gravitropic perception and response tissues in the columella and epidermis, respectively. We propose that EGT1 controls root angle by regulating cell wall stiffness in elongating root cortical tissue, counteracting the gravitropic machinery’s known ability to bend the root via its outermost tissues.

frl:6525163,"['BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The RTK-RAS signaling cascade is a central axis in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis, governing cellular proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance. Somatic alterations in key pathway genes—including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR—are pivotal to clinical decision-making in precision oncology. However, the integration of these genomic events with clinical and demographic data remains hindered by fragmented resources and a lack of accessible analytical frameworks. To address this challenge, we developed AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS, a domain-specialized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to enable natural language-based, integrative analysis of RTK-RAS pathway alterations in CRC. METHODS: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS employs a modular architecture combining large language models (LLMs), a natural language-to-code translation engine, and a backend analytics pipeline operating on harmonized multi-dimensional datasets from cBioPortal. Unlike general-purpose AI platforms, this system is purpose-built for real-time exploration of RTK-RAS biology within CRC cohorts. The platform supports mutation frequency profiling, odds ratio testing, survival modeling, and stratified analyses across clinical, genomic, and demographic parameters. Validation included reproduction of known mutation trends and exploratory evaluation of co-alterations, therapy response, and ancestry-specific mutation patterns. Results: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS enabled rapid, dialogue-driven interrogation of CRC datasets, confirming established patterns and revealing novel associations with translational relevance. Among early-onset CRC (EOCRC) patients, the prevalence of RTK-RAS alterations was significantly lower compared to late-onset disease (67.97% vs. 79.9%; OR = 0.534, p = 0.014), suggesting the involvement of alternative oncogenic drivers. In KRAS-mutant patients receiving Bevacizumab, early-stage disease (Stages I–III) was associated with superior overall survival relative to Stage IV (p = 0.0004). In contrast, BRAF-mutant tumors with microsatellite-stable (MSS) status displayed poorer prognosis despite higher chemotherapy exposure (OR = 7.226, p < 0.001; p = 0.0000). Among EOCRC patients treated with FOLFOX, RTK-RAS alterations were linked to worse outcomes (p = 0.0262). The system also identified ancestry-enriched noncanonical mutations—including CBL, MAPK3, and NF1—with NF1 mutations significantly associated with improved prognosis (p = 1 × 10−5). CONCLUSIONS: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS exemplifies a new class of conversational AI platforms tailored to precision oncology, enabling integrative, real-time analysis of clinically and biologically complex questions. Its ability to uncover both canonical and ancestry-specific patterns in RTK-RAS dysregulation—especially in EOCRC and populations with disproportionate health burdens—underscores its utility in advancing equitable, personalized cancer care. This work demonstrates the translational potential of domain-optimized AI tools to accelerate biomarker discovery, support therapeutic stratification, and democratize access to multi-omic analysis.']",public,['13(8):1835'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgRWktV2Vu', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Ei-Wen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0009-5991-9779', 'prefLabel': 'Waldrup, Brigette'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3603-6414', 'prefLabel': 'Velazquez-Villarreal, Enrique'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Precision Oncology Through Dialogue: AI-HOPE-RTK-RAS Integrates Clinical and Genomic Insights into RTK-RAS Alterations in Colorectal Cancer'],2025-07-28T11:18:41.047+0200,355.0

This study is aimed to investigate the influence of extraction methods (steam distillation, ethanol Soxhlet extraction, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, subcritical n-butane extraction) on the yield, aroma properties, chemical composition, and bioactivity of star anise essential oils. Electronic nose detection revealed the essential oils from subcritical extraction exhibited the most intense aroma, while the essential oils from ethanol Soxhlet extraction had a more complex aroma profile. Fourier-transform infrared analysis showed the presence of benzene rings, carbonyl groups, C=C, and aromatic ether bonds in the essential oils extracted through different methods. The major components were heterocyclic olefins, heterocyclic oxygenates, and aromatic oxygenates, as well as certain amounts of flavonoids and polyphenols. Correlation analysis revealed the relative contents of volatile trans-anethole, wormwood, d-limonene, cineole, and trans-α-citronelene were strongly associated with the antibacterial activity of the essential oils. Similarly, the contents of volatile components (d-limonene, cineole) and non-volatile components (total flavonoids and total polyphenols) were strongly correlated with the DPPH scavenging activity of the essential oils. These results confirm the effectiveness of the ethanol Soxhlet extraction method in retaining the bioactivity of the essential oils. Finally, with a Box–Behnken central composite design of response surface and single-factor experiments, the optimal extraction conditions for the ethanol Soxhlet method were determined: ultrasonic frequency of 80\u2009kHz, crushing particle size of 60 meshes, liquid–material ratio of 8:1 (mL:g), and ultrasonic time of 35\u2009min. Under these conditions, the essential oil yield was 25.51%\u2009±\u20090.21%.

This study aimed to compare the neuropathic pain produced by the prolonged exposure of light-responsive pain mice to blue light. A reversible neuropathic pain state was established persisting for a minimum of 24 hours when each light-responsive pain mouse was irradiated with light of an intensity that consistently elicited pain. Furthermore, the mice also showed pain sensitivity to light irradiation and mechanical stimulation. The expression of c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity following noxious stimulation, was increased in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord on the light irradiated side. DS-1971a, a selective NaV1.7 inhibitor, was effective in attenuating neuropathic pain in all light-responsive pain mice.

For species whose seeds are extremely short-lived, or rarely or never produce seeds, or whose genetic makeup must be preserved, cryopreservation offers the only possibility for long-term conservation. At temperatures below freezing, most vegetative plant tissues suffer severe damage from ice crystal formation and require protection. In this review, we describe how increasing the concentration of cellular solutes by air drying or adding cryoprotectants, together with rapid cooling, results in a vitrified, highly viscous state in which cells can remain viable and be stored. On this basis, a range of dormant bud-freezing, slow-cooling, and (droplet-)vitrification protocols have been developed, but few are used to cryobank important agricultural/horticultural/timber and threatened species. To improve cryopreservation efficiency, the effects of cryoprotectants and molecular processes need to be understood and the costs for cryobanking reduced.

Developed using a New Product Development approach, the powders were derived from underutilized plants rich in bioactives but with limited sensory appeal. Formulations included powders from both widely available fruits, such as apple and pear, chosen for their accessibility and economic relevance, and less commonly consumed fruits, such as Japanese quince, rosehip, and rhubarb, which are often discarded due to sour or astringent flavors. Processing these into powders helped mask undesirable sensory traits and enabled incorporation into beverage matrices. Physicochemical analyses confirmed their technological suitability, while high polyphenol content indicated potential health benefits. Importantly, no process contaminants (furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl-L-furfural, and acrylamide) were detected, supporting the powders’ safety for food use. The integrated application of an electronic tongue and nose enabled objective profiling of taste and aroma. The electronic tongue distinguished taste profiles across formulations, revealing matrix-dependent effects and interactions, particularly with trehalose, that influenced sweetness and bitterness. The electronic nose provided consistent aroma differentiation. Overall, the results highlight the potential of these underutilized plant powders as multifunctional ingredients in plant-based beverage development. They support product innovation aligned with consumer expectations for natural, health-promoting foods. Future work will include sensory validation with consumer panels']",public,['14(15):2593'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1933-2852', 'prefLabel': 'Kolniak-Ostek, Joanna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9940-7657', 'prefLabel': 'Kita, Agnieszka'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2498-0632', 'prefLabel': 'Giacalone, Davide'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4174-9283', 'prefLabel': 'VÁZQUEZ-ARAÚJO, LAURA'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9269-1125', 'prefLabel': 'Noguera-Artiaga, Luis'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5127-2706', 'prefLabel': 'Brzezowska, Jessica'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8212-7894', 'prefLabel': 'MICHALSKA-CIECHANOWSKA, Anna'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Physicochemical and Instrumental Flavor Analysis of Plant-Based Drinks with Plant Powder Additions'],2025-07-24T10:59:45.589+0200,355.0
frl:6509991,"[""Saffron, similar to numerous other agricultural commodities, is susceptible to microbial contamination during cultivation and postharvest handling. Cold plasma treatment has emerged as an effective method for microbial inactivation while preserving food quality. The aim of this research was to preserve the color integrity and minimize the presence of microorganisms in dried saffron stigma by implementing cold plasma pre-treatment. Process parameters were optimized using the response surface method (RSM), considering the type of atmosphere (argon and air), plasma exposure time (1, 5, and 10\u2009min), and plasma power (40, 70, and 100\u2009W) as independent variables. The objectives were to maximize crocin content and minimize the total microbial load. The analysis of the response surface revealed that the argon atmosphere had a more significant impact on reducing microbial contamination than air, and an increase in plasma exposure time led to a decrease in microbial load. The maximum reduction in microbial load, by 0.9 logarithmic cycles compared to the control, was achieved with a 10-min treatment at 40\u2009W power. Extended plasma exposure durations led to a minor reduction in the color, taste, aroma, and antioxidant properties of saffron stigma. Specifically, the color, taste, and aroma decreased by 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0.08%, respectively, with longer plasma exposure times. The antioxidant activity decreased by 0.64% with prolonged exposure time. However, the plasma-treated samples did not show any signs of Escherichia coli, mold, or yeast. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that the type of atmosphere significantly influenced the reduction of infection and maintenance of saffron stigma's color quality. Cold plasma pretreatment holds promise as a viable method for preserving the physicochemical attributes of saffron while effectively reducing microbial contamination.""]",public,['12(10):7417-7427'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmlyamFuZGkgVG9yb2doaSwgWm9ocmVo', 'prefLabel': 'Birjandi Toroghi, Zohreh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tmlhem1hbmQsIFJhemllaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Niazmand, Razieh'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8300-2276', 'prefLabel': 'Moradinezhad, Farid'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmF5YXQsIEhhc3Nhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Bayat, Hassan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Potential of cold plasma pretreatment for preserving biochemical attributes and ensuring the microbiological safety of saffron stigma'],2025-02-10T11:34:40.087+0100,286.0

The structural variants uncovered by these datasets are a major asset to genetic analysis in crop plants(2). Here we report a pangenome of barley comprising long-read sequence assemblies of 76 wild and domesticated genomes and short-read sequence data of 1,315 genotypes. An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains. Our findings indicate that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems.']",public,['636(8043):654-662'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2951-0541', 'prefLabel': 'Jayakodi, Murukarthick'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1358-2623', 'prefLabel':

frl:6511206,"[""Single-value scores reflecting the deviation from (FADE score) or similarity with (SAME score) prototypical novelty-related and memory-related functional MRI activation patterns in young adults have been proposed as imaging biomarkers of healthy neurocognitive ageing. Here, we tested the utility of these scores as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD). To this end, we analysed subsequent memory functional MRI data from individuals with SCD, MCI and AD dementia as well as healthy controls and first-degree relatives of AD dementia patients (AD-rel) who participated in the multi-centre DELCODE study (n = 468). Based on the individual participants' whole-brain functional MRI novelty and subsequent memory responses, we calculated the FADE and SAME scores and assessed their association with AD risk stage, neuropsychological test scores, CSF amyloid positivity and APOE genotype. Memory-based FADE and SAME scores showed a considerably larger deviation from a reference sample of young adults in the MCI and AD dementia groups compared to healthy controls, SCD and AD-rel. In addition, novelty-based scores significantly differed between the MCI and AD dementia groups. Across the entire sample, single-value scores correlated with neuropsychological test performance. The novelty-based SAME score further differed between Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative individuals in SCD and AD-rel, and between ApoE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers in AD-rel.

The molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis are complex and not fully understood. In vivo experiments are essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of the disease. However, the diverse principles behind mouse modeling techniques for liver fibrosis can complicate the elucidation of specific fibrotic mechanisms. \r\nMETHODS:\r\nFive distinct liver fibrosis models were utilized: CONTROL, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), BDL (bile duct ligation), TAA (thioacetamide), and CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride). Patents for these drugs were reviewed using Patentscope® and Worldwide Espacenet®. ScRNA-seq was performed to analyze and compare the cellular and molecular differences in these models. \r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe analysis revealed that, particularly in the drug-induced fibrosis models, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), Kupffer cells, and T-cell subsets exhibit distinct regulatory patterns and dynamic remodeling processes across different liver fibrosis models. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of immune responses and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in various models, providing important insights into the complex mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis. \r\nCONNCLUSIONS:\r\nThe study enhances our understanding of liver fibrosis development and provides valuable insights for selecting the most representative animal models in future research.

This study focuses on evaluating seven Sauerkraut-derived RAMULAB strains isolated from sauerkraut, aiming to identify promising candidates for modulating α-glucosidase (AG) and α-amylase (AM) enzymatic functions. RAMULAB strains with remarkable probiotic potential can contribute to the digestive health and manage conditions like diabetes. Identifying robust candidates from sauerkraut, a fermented food, holds promise for natural and cost-effective probiotic sources. The RAMULAB strains underwent extensive characterization, including identification through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. Their tolerance to harsh conditions, adherence properties, antimicrobial activity, antioxidant potential, and inhibition of AG and AM were assessed. In silico analyses explored their molecular interactions, particularly with hydroxycitric acid, a potential antidiabetic compound. Among the RAMULAB strains, RAMULAB48 emerged as a standout candidate. It displayed exceptional resilience to acidic bile (≥97%), and simulated gastrointestinal conditions (≥95%), highlighting its suitability for probiotic applications. RAMULAB48 exhibited robust adherence properties, including cell-surface hydrophobicity (80%), autoaggregation (42%), coaggregation with pathogens (≥33%), and adhesion to epithelial cells. Additionally, all seven isolates demonstrated gamma-hemolysis and resistance to antibiotics (Kanamycin, Methicillin, and Vancomycin), while displaying strong antibacterial properties against foodborne pathogens. These RAMULAB strains also exhibited varying degrees of antioxidant activity, with RAMULAB48 displaying the highest potential (≥41%). In terms of antidiabetic activity, cell-free supernatant (CS) obtained from RAMULAB48 expressed the highest inhibition levels, notably inhibiting yeast AG by an impressive 59.55% and AM being by a remarkable 67.42%. RAMULAB48 produced organic acids, including hydroxycitric acid (28.024\u2009mg/mL), which showed promising antidiabetic properties through in silico analyses, indicating favorable interactions with the target enzymes. This study identifies Lacticaseibacillus paracasei RAMULAB48, a Sauerkraut-derived RAMULAB strain, as a promising probiotic candidate with exceptional tolerance, adherence properties, antimicrobial activity, antioxidant potential, and antidiabetic effects.

frl:6510037,"['At many vertebrate synapses, presynaptic functions are tuned by expression of different Cav2 channels. Most invertebrate genomes contain only one Cav2 gene. The Drosophila Cav2 homolog, cacophony (cac), induces synaptic vesicle release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). We hypothesize that Drosophila cac functional diversity is enhanced by two mutually exclusive exon pairs that are not conserved in vertebrates, one in the voltage sensor and one in the loop binding Caβ and Gβγ subunits. We find that alternative splicing in the voltage sensor affects channel activation voltage. Only the isoform with the higher activation voltage localizes to AZs at the glutamatergic Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and is imperative for normal synapse function. By contrast, alternative splicing at the other alternative exon pair tunes multiple aspects of presynaptic function. While expression of one exon yields normal transmission, expression of the other reduces channel number in the AZ and thus release probability. This also abolishes presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Moreover, reduced channel number affects short-term plasticity, which is rescued by increasing the external calcium concentration to match release probability to control. In sum, in Drosophila alternative splicing provides a mechanism to regulate different aspects of presynaptic functions with only one Cav2 gene.

Specifically, we investigate how social stressors relate to exhaustion and positive affect at the end of the day within the context of different work settings.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This research draws insights from a sample comprising 99 employed individuals who diligently responded to surveys over a span of up to 10 working days (with an average of 6 days) after work and prior to bedtime.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Although the absolute level of encountered social stressors exhibited no noteworthy difference between working at home or the premise of the employer, the relationship to exhaustion was moderated by the work location. Remarkably, the positive link between challenge-oriented social stressors and exhaustion manifested solely on days spent working from home. In contrast, social hindrance stressors exhibited a positive association with exhaustion exclusively on days when employees were operating within the organizational premise.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: These findings offer preliminary indications that the significance of specific stressors might indeed fluctuate based on the physical location of work.

frl:6511775,"[""AIM:\r\nThe non-stationarity in habitat selection of expanding populations poses a significant challenge for spatial forecasting. Focusing on the grey wolf (Canis lupus) natural recolonization of Germany, we compared the performance of different distribution modelling approaches for predicting habitat suitability in unoccupied areas. Furthermore, we analysed whether grey wolf showed non-stationarity in habitat selection in newly colonized areas, which will impact the predictions for potential habitat.\r\nLOCATION:\r\nGermany.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nUsing telemetry data as presence points, we compared the predictive performance of five modelling approaches based on combinations of distribution modelling algorithms—GLMM, MaxEnt and ensemble modelling—and two background point selection strategies. We used a homogeneous Poisson point process to draw background points from either the minimum convex polygons derived from telemetry or the whole area known to be occupied by wolves. Models were fit to the data of the first years and validated against independent data representing the expansion of the species. The best-performing approach was then used to further investigate non-stationarity in the species' response in spatiotemporal restricted datasets that represented different colonization steps.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nWhile all approaches performed similarly when evaluated against a subset of the data used to fit the models, the ensemble model based on integrated data performed best when predicting range expansion. Models for subsequent colonization steps differed substantially from the global model, highlighting the non-stationarity of wolf habitat selection towards human disturbance during the colonization process.\r\nMAIN CONCLUSIONS:\r\nWhile telemetry-only data overfitted the models, using all available datasets increased the reliability of the range expansion forecasts. The non-stationarity in habitat selection pointed to wolves settling in the best areas first, and filling in nearby lower-quality habitat as the population increases. Our results caution against spatial extrapolation and space-for-time substitutions in habitat models, at least with expanding species.\r\n""]",public,['30(1):71-86'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6763-9923', 'prefLabel': 'Planillo, Aimara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VuemxlcuKAkE1leWEsIE1vcml0eg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wenzler‐Meya, Moritz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVpbmhhcmR0LCBJbGth', 'prefLabel': 'Reinhardt, Ilka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2x1dGgsIEdlc2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Kluth, Gesa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWljaGxlciwgRnJhbmvigJBVd2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Michler, Frank‐Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RpZXIsIE5vcm1hbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Stier, Norman'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG91dnJpZXIsIEp1bGll', 'prefLabel': 'Louvrier, Julie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RleWVyLCBLYXRoYXJpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Steyer, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2lsbGljaCwgQmVuamFtaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Gillich, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmllZ2VyLCBTaWVnZnJpZWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Rieger, Siegfried'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S25hdWVyLCBGZWxpeA==', 'prefLabel': 'Knauer, Felix'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VlbW1lcmxlLCBUb2JpYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Kuemmerle, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVy4oCQU2NoYWR0LCBTdGVwaGFuaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer‐Schadt, Stephanie'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Understanding habitat selection of range-expanding populations of large carnivores: 20\u2009years of grey wolves (Canis lupus) recolonizing Germany'],2025-06-12T07:41:15.184+0200,336.0

The SNPs were selected from whole-genome resequencing data containing 2,214 diverse soybean accessions; 29.34% of the SNPs mapped to genic regions representing 86.85% of the 56,044 annotated high-confidence genes. Identity-by-state analyses of 318 soybeans revealed 17 redundant accessions, highlighting the potential of the SoySNP618K array in supporting gene bank management. The patterns of population stratification and genomic regions enriched through domestication were highly consistent with previous findings based on resequencing data, suggesting that the ascertainment bias in the SoySNP618K array was largely compensated for. Genome-wide association mapping in combination with reported quantitative trait loci enabled fine-mapping of genes known to influence flowering time, E2 and GmPRR3b, and of a new candidate gene, GmVIP5. Moreover, genomic prediction of flowering and maturity time in 502 recombinant inbred lines was highly accurate (above 0.65). Thus, the SoySNP618K array is a valuable genomic tool that can be used to address many questions in applied breeding, germplasm management, and basic crop research.

FA, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is processed with TBB to enhance its gastrointestinal motility benefits. The study's objectives were to assess the impact of this preparation on intestinal flora, SCFA levels, and metabolomic profiles in FD. Rats were divided into groups receiving different treatments, with the TBB-FA group showing a 7.15–33.2 times increase in fecal SCFA levels, specifically propionate and butyrate, compared to the Fructus aurantii (FA) stir-baked with wheat bran (WB) group (WB-FA) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Metabolomics identified 23 serum and 11 intestinal mucosal biomarkers associated with FD, predominantly linked to the purine metabolic pathway. Results indicated a significant positive correlation (r\u2009≥\u20090.7) between the abundance of Bacteroides and the expression of propionate and isobutyrate in fecal samples post-TBB-FA treatment. This suggests that TBB-FA may enhance beneficial gut bacteria and SCFA production, potentially modulating the purinergic signaling pathway, which is implicated in gastrointestinal motility. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that TBB-FA could be a promising therapeutic approach for FD by improving gut microbiota and SCFA levels and highlights the purinergic signaling pathway as a novel target for treatment.

In nutritional and food science, LZM interacts with TA, notably in wine and saliva. This study aimed to investigate the binding interaction between LZM and TA using surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation. Chicken egg white lysozyme (CEWLZM) was applied as a model protein. Tri-N-acetylchitotriose (NAG3), the known inhibitor of CEWLZM, was used in the redocking experiments to determine the precise binding location within the complex. The average binding energies obtained from docking NAG3 and tannic acid to the target structure of CEWLZM were found to be −6.46\u2009±\u20090.05\u2009kcal/mol and −7.52\u2009±\u20090.39\u2009kcal/mol, respectively. The binding free energy of the CEWLZM-TA complex was then calculated as −27.61\u2009kcal/mol by MMPBSA based on MD simulation trajectories. The observed interactions between the ligands and the lysozyme structure were mainly driven by hydrophobic, van der Waals, and H-bond interactions formed by the active site residues. MD simulations showed consistent and satisfactory binding distances between CEWLZM and TA throughout the analysis.

The MTT experiment revealed that quinoa saponins significantly decreased the proliferative vitality of HT-29 cells. In comparison to the control group, the proportion of cell number in the G0/G1 phase increased by 22.97% and the rate of apoptosis increased by 22.55% after treating cells with quinoa saponins (40\u2009μg/mL).

It also promoted the expression of Caspase3 and Bax while suppressing the expression of Bcl-2, which led to the apoptosis of HT-29 cells. In addition, quinoa saponins caused cells to undergo autophagy by upregulating the expression of LC-3II and Beclin1, while the addition of autophagy inhibitors significantly reduced the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Finally, the migration of HT-29 cells was also inhibited by quinoa saponins. After treating cells with quinoa saponins (40\u2009μg/mL), compared with that in the control group, the wound healing rate of cells decreased by 38.21% and the migration ability decreased by 69.48%. The potential mechanism could be connected to increasing E-cadherin expression while decreasing N-cadherin expression.

There are insufficient data on the coverage of treatment for diabetes and how it has changed. We estimated trends from 1990 to 2022 in diabetes prevalence and treatment for 200 countries and territories. METHODS: We used data from 1108 population-representative studies with 141 million participants aged 18 years and older with measurements of fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and information on diabetes treatment. We defined diabetes as having a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7·0 mmol/L or higher, having an HbA1c of 6·5% or higher, or taking medication for diabetes. We defined diabetes treatment as the proportion of people with diabetes who were taking medication for diabetes. We analysed the data in a Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression model to estimate diabetes prevalence and treatment. FINDINGS: In 2022, an estimated 828 million (95% credible interval [CrI] 757–908) adults (those aged 18 years and older) had diabetes, an increase of 630 million (554–713) from 1990. From 1990 to 2022, the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes increased in 131 countries for women and in 155 countries for men with a posterior probability of more than 0·80. The largest increases were in low-income and middle-income countries in southeast Asia (eg, Malaysia), south Asia (eg, Pakistan), the Middle East and north Africa (eg, Egypt), and Latin America and the Caribbean (eg, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica). Age-standardised prevalence neither increased nor decreased with a posterior probability of more than 0·80 in some countries in western and central Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, east Asia and the Pacific, Canada, and some Pacific island nations where prevalence was already high in 1990; it decreased with a posterior probability of more than 0·80 in women in Japan, Spain, and France, and in men in Nauru. The lowest prevalence in the world in 2022 was in western Europe and east Africa for both sexes, and in Japan and Canada for women, and the highest prevalence in the world in 2022 was in countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, some countries in the Caribbean and the Middle East and north Africa, as well as Pakistan and Malaysia. In 2022, 445 million (95% CrI 401–496) adults aged 30 years or older with diabetes did not receive treatment (59% of adults aged 30 years or older with diabetes), 3·5 times the number in 1990. From 1990 to 2022, diabetes treatment coverage increased in 118 countries for women and 98 countries for men with a posterior probability of more than 0·80. The largest improvement in treatment coverage was in some countries from central and western Europe and Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Costa Rica), Canada, South Korea, Russia, Seychelles, and Jordan. There was no increase in treatment coverage in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa; the Caribbean; Pacific island nations; and south, southeast, and central Asia. In 2022, age-standardised treatment coverage was lowest in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and treatment coverage was less than 10% in some African countries. Treatment coverage was 55% or higher in South Korea, many high-income western countries, and some countries in central and eastern Europe (eg, Poland, Czechia, and Russia), Latin America (eg, Costa Rica, Chile, and Mexico), and the Middle East and north Africa (eg, Jordan, Qatar, and Kuwait). INTERPRETATION: In most countries, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, diabetes treatment has not increased at all or has not increased sufficiently in comparison with the rise in prevalence. The burden of diabetes and untreated diabetes is increasingly borne by low-income and middle-income countries. The expansion of health insurance and primary health care should be accompanied with diabetes programmes that realign and resource health services to enhance the early detection and effective treatment of diabetes.']",public,['404(10467):2077-2093'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TkNEIFJpc2sgRmFjdG9yIENvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24=', 'prefLabel': 'NCD Risk Factor Collaboration'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Worldwide trends in diabetes prevalence and treatment from 1990 to 2022: A pooled analysis of 1101 population-representative studies with 82 million participants'],2025-07-31T11:04:24.165+0200,266.0

In this study, the oddball paradigm, which is well established in laboratory settings for studying attention, is transferred to table tennis in a virtual environment. While 33 subjects played virtual table tennis, they were presented with a task-irrelevant sequence of frequent standard sounds and infrequent novel sounds. Trials in which an unexpected novel sound preceded the ball’s appearance resulted in a delayed racket movement compared to trials in which a standard sound was presented. This distraction effect was observed in the first part of the experiment but disappeared with increasing exposure. The results suggest that unexpected and task-irrelevant novel sounds can initially distract attention and impair performance on a complex movement task in a rich environment.

The most effective combination was the application of divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber coating used at 60°C for 30\u2009min for extraction and 1\u2009min for desorption. The optimized method was applied to investigate the volatile profile of 14 pollen samples (three rapeseed, musk thistle, rock-rose, traveler's joy, dropwort, honey locust, sunflower, red poppy, phacelia, sweet cherry, wild blackberry, and dandelion). The volatile profiles of bee pollens were different and were crucially depended on botanical origin. The aroma activity of the samples was generated by 31.0%–48.3% of total volatiles. The number of the identified odorants were between 75 and 101 in the pollen samples by GC–MS, of which 26–42 were aroma-active.

Yet, how these seasonal nutrient cycling processes are modified by climate change and what the consequences are for nutrient loss and retention in alpine ecosystems remain unclear. Here, we explored how two pervasive climate change factors, reduced snow cover and shrub expansion, interactively modify the seasonal coupling of plant and soil microbial nitrogen (N) cycling in alpine grasslands, which are warming at double the rate of the global average. We found that the combination of reduced snow cover and shrub expansion disrupted the seasonal coupling of plant and soil N-cycling, with pronounced effects in spring (shortly after snow melt) and autumn (at the onset of plant senescence). In combination, both climate change factors decreased plant organic N-uptake by 70% and 82%, soil microbial biomass N by 19% and 38% and increased soil denitrifier abundances by 253% and 136% in spring and autumn, respectively. Shrub expansion also individually modified the seasonality of soil microbial community composition and stoichiometry towards more N-limited conditions and slower nutrient cycling in spring and autumn. In winter, snow removal markedly reduced the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio, soil N pools and shifted bacterial community composition. Taken together, our findings suggest that interactions between climate change factors can disrupt the temporal coupling of plant and soil microbial N-cycling processes in alpine grasslands. This could diminish the capacity of these globally widespread alpine ecosystems to retain N and support plant productivity under future climate change.']",public,['30(3):e17245'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8438-7163', 'prefLabel': 'Broadbent, Arthur'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmV3Ym9sZCwgTGluZHNheSBLLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Newbold, Lindsay K.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJpdGNoYXJkLCBXaWxsaWFtIEou', 'prefLabel': 'Pritchard, William J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWljaGFzLCBBbnRvbmlvcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Michas, Antonios'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29vZGFsbCwgVGlt', 'prefLabel': 'Goodall, Tim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29yZGVybywgSXJlbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Cordero, Irene'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2l1bnRhLCBBbmRyZXc=', 'prefLabel': 'Giunta, Andrew'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U25lbGwsIEhlbGVuIFMuIEsu', 'prefLabel': 'Snell, Helen S.

Specifically, it may be challenging for some animals to find enough food in urban environments to achieve a positive energy balance. Because urban environments favor small-sized bats with low energy requirements, we hypothesized that common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) acquire food at a slower rate and rely less on conspecifics to find prey in urban than in rural environments due to a low food abundance and predictable distribution of insects in urban environments. To address this, we estimated prey sizes and measured prey capture rates, foraging efforts, and the presence of conspecifics during hunting of 22 common noctule bats equipped with sensor loggers in an urban and rural environment. Even though common noctule bats hunted similar-sized prey in both environments, urban bats captured prey at a lower rate (mean: 2.4 vs. 6.3 prey attacks/min), and a lower total amount of prey (mean: 179 vs. 377 prey attacks/foraging bout) than conspecifics from rural environments. Consequently, the energy expended to capture prey was higher for common noctules in urban than in rural environments. In line with our prediction, urban bats relied less on group hunting, likely because group hunting was unnecessary in an environment where the spatial distribution of prey insects is predictable, for example, in parks or around floodlights. While acknowledging the limitations of a small sample size and low number of spatial replicates, our study suggests that scarce food resources may make urban habitats unfavorable for large bat species with higher energy requirements compared to smaller bat species. In conclusion, a lower food intake may displace larger species from urban areas making habitats with high insect biomass production key for protecting large bat species in urban environments.']",public,['30(1):e17063'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2187-7835', 'prefLabel': 'Stidsholt, Laura'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2283-7437', 'prefLabel': 'Scholz, Carolin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVybWFubnMsIFV3ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hermanns, Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVpZ2UsIFRvYmlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Teige, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG9zdCwgTWFydGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Post, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1299-4981', 'prefLabel': 'Stapelfeldt, Bianca'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7704-5683', 'prefLabel': 'Reusch, Christine'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0706-3974', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Low foraging rates drive large insectivorous bats away from urban areas'],2025-06-12T07:48:46.259+0200,336.0

This early gestation period is particularly sensitive to stress, which can cause reduced fertility and reproductive disorders in mammals. Nevertheless, the local impact of elevated stress hormones on the oviduct epithelium has received limited attention to date, except for a few reports on polyovulatory species like mice and pigs. In this study, we focused on the effects of chronic maternal stress on cattle, given its association with infertility issues in this monoovulatory species. Bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOEC) differentiated at the air–liquid interface (ALI) were stimulated with 250 nmol/L cortisol for 1 or 3 weeks. Subsequently, they were assessed for morphology, bioelectrical properties, and gene expression related to oviduct function, glucocorticoid pathway, cortisol metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis. Results revealed adverse effects of cortisol on epithelium structure, featured by deciliation, vacuole formation, and multilayering. Additionally, cortisol exposure led to an increase in transepithelial potential difference, downregulated mRNA expression of the major glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), upregulated the expression of cortisol-responsive genes (FKBP5, TSC22D3), and significant downregulation of oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) and steroid receptors PGR and ESR1. The systematic comparison to a similar experiment previously performed by us in porcine oviduct epithelial cells, indicated that bovine cultures were more susceptible to elevated cortisol levels than porcine. The distinct responses between both species are likely linked to their divergence in the cortisol-induced expression changes of HSD11B2, an enzyme controlling the cellular capacity to metabolise cortisol. These findings provide insights into the species-specific reactions and reproductive consequences triggered by maternal stress.']",public,['15(1):129'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FobCwgRmlvbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Wahl, Fiona'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVvLCBKaWFuY2hhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Huo, Jianchao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHUsIFNodWFpemhp', 'prefLabel': 'Du, Shuaizhi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5790-3217', 'prefLabel': 'Schoen, Jennifer'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0139-5545', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Shuai'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Maternal stress and the early embryonic microenvironment: investigating long-term cortisol effects on bovine oviductal epithelial cells using air–liquid interface culture'],2025-06-12T07:52:43.588+0200,336.0

Establishing methods to grow and culture these oocytes from those follicles in the laboratory might fuel efforts towards in vitro embryo production in this species without the need for repeated in vivo oocyte collection. In depth understanding of the biology behind and improvement of assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) is the only option for preventing the disappearance of functionally extinct species such as the northern white rhinoceros. In vitro follicle development can only be obtained by in depth knowledge on rhinoceros ovarian histology. In addition to known ovarian features, we identified numerous undescribed structural and molecular ovarian characteristics from adult southern white rhinoceros (n=3). Ovarian sections were stained with H&E, PAS or Masson Trichrome and molecular analyses (hyaluronic acid detection, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay) were performed to identify proliferation, extracellular matrix, pluripotency markers, hormones, enzymes, markers for inflammation or endocrine glands, blood vessel presence, oocyte markers and apoptosis. Besides degenerating, deformed, or luteinized follicles, analysis revealed several ‘follicle-like structures’ (FLS) that deviated from the expected follicle appearance. Most importantly, the majority of FLS did not contain any oocyte and were comprised of a collection of cells organised around fluid islands with or without an antral cavity. The discovery and description of FLS in aged southern white rhinoceroses may play a role in poor oocyte recovery rates in ovum pick-up (OPU) in older rhinoceroses.

METHODS: Five databases (Cochrane Library, Medline (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (EBSCO)) were searched from inception to April 2024 for RCTs that evaluated conservative non-pharmacological interventions for UI in older adults living with frailty. Two independent reviewers screened records, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0) Tool and Level of Evidence was summarised using GRADE guidelines. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model or narrative synthesis were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs, including 1,580 participants, with medium to high risk of bias were included. Conservative non-pharmacological interventions (categorised as single component or multicomponent interventions) resulted in a non-statistically significant reduction of objective measures of UI (6 RCTs, g\u2009=\u2009-0.39, p\u2009=\u20090.090; pooled effect size, with CI\u2009=\u2009-0.39 [-0.832, 0.060], I2\u2009=\u200985.26%, with very low certainty of evidence).

frl:6511643,"['INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR), a common chronic disease triggered by allergens, often leads to school absenteeism in students. Investigating its magnitude and risk factors may play an important role in preventing the disease. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and associated factors among high school students living in industrial areas in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A school-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in September 2023 among 442 randomly selected high school students. Data was collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire. Questions on allergic disease symptoms were based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) core allergy and environmental questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify the factors associated with allergic rhinitis. Finally, Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% Confidence interval and P-value less than 0.05 was used to judge the statistical significance. RESULTS: This study found that the magnitude of allergic rhinitis was 20.7% (95% CI: 17.0%, 24.8%). Similarly, this study identified that a family history of allergic rhinitis (AOR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.42–6.29) and living with a smoker in the household (AOR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.22–10.78) were significant risk factors. Conversely, living in a house far from traffic roads (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15–0.67) and far from factories (AOR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03–0.31) were protective factors against allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found a lower magnitude of allergic rhinitis compared to the previous studies conducted in African countries. Having a smoker family member, distance between the house and nearest traffic road, distance between the house and nearest factory, and family history of allergy rhinitis were factors associated with allergy rhinitis. Hence, provision of health education to encourage people to stop smoking is strongly recommended.

Understanding and predicting these reactions is critical for safe clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate a clinically predictive score for allergic reactions during OFCs in pediatric patients. METHODS: Using a retrospective database of pediatric patients undergoing OFCs at a pediatric outpatient clinic in Southern Thailand from January 2014 to December 2022, a multivariable predictive model was developed. Data on the reaction rates, demographics, and treatments were collected. Logistic regression analysis with predictor selection using a backward stepwise approach, was employed. The model’s performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration, and classification measures. RESULTS: This study included 179 patients with an allergic reaction incidence of 12.3%. Predictors encompassed female, anaphylaxis and positive skin prick testing. The developed model achieved an ROC of 0.71. The patients were categorized into the low-risk (score 0–1) and high-risk (score 2–3) groups. Reaction rates during the OFCs were 6.7% in the low-risk group and 29.5% in the high-risk group.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the nerve regeneration ability of Bio 3D conduits made from UC-MSCs using a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Methods: A Bio 3D conduit was fabricated using a Bio 3D printer by placing UC-MSC spheroids into thin needles according to predesigned 3D data. The conduit was transplanted to bridge the 5-mm gaps of Lewis rat sciatic nerve, and nerve regeneration was evaluated at 8 weeks (Bio 3D group). Transplantation of autologous nerve segments (autograft) and silicone tubes represented the positive and negative control groups, respectively. In a second experiment, immunological reactions were evaluated in Bio 3D, autograft, and allograft groups by histochemical staining of transplanted segments in Brown Norway rats. Results: The mean angle of attack value in the kinematic analysis was significantly better in the Bio 3D group (‒20.1 ± 0.5°) than in the silicone group (‒33.7 ± 1.5°) 8 weeks after surgery. The average diameters of myelinated axons were significantly larger in the Bio 3D group (3.61 ± 0.15 μm) than in the silicone group (3.07 ± 0.12 μm), and the number of myelinated axons was significantly higher in the Bio 3D group (11,201 ± 980) than in the silicone group (8117 ± 646). Histological findings (hematoxylin and eosin [HE] staining and anti-CD3 fluorescent immunostaining) showed that rejection was suppressed in the Bio 3D group compared to the allograft group. Based on macroscopic findings and histological findings (anti-human mitochondrial fluorescent immunostaining), UC-MSCs in the Bio 3D conduit disappeared gradually from week 1 to week 8. Conclusions: The Bio 3D conduit prepared from UC-MSCs was superior to the silicone tube and achieved comparable nerve regeneration to the autologous (autograft) group. Rejection was suppressed in the Bio 3D group compared to the allograft group. Although this study used a xenograft model, we speculate that rejection was low due to the characteristics of UC-MSCs.

However, treatment varies by patient and disease activity, and existing medications for SLE were far from satisfactory. Novel drug targets to be found for SLE therapy are still needed. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR), an observational study way, was performed to explore potential drug targets for SLE using protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from recently published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma proteins, which obtained genetic instruments for 154 CSF proteins of 971 participants, and 734 plasma proteins of 23591 participants. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis, colocalization analysis, and phenotype scanning were performed to find key proteins for SLE. In addition, external data verification was implemented to further consolidate the Mendelian randomization findings. Candidate proteins as targets to find drugs and discuss the druggability. Finally, Network pharmacology and molecular docking methods were used to verify the effects of Voclosporin and Cyclosporine on SLE targets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and core target analysis of candidate drugs and SLE overlapping targets were performed to identify potential hub targets and interactions. The affinity between drug targets and SLE targets was confirmed by molecular docking. RESULTS: In the preliminary analysis, we identified four key proteins as possible drug targets in CSF and plasma proteins, included ICAM-1(P = 4.62E-05, OR = 0.90(0.86, 0.95)), sICAM-1(P = 4.62E-05, OR = 0.49(0.35, 0.69)), FCG2B (P = 7.63E-11, OR = 0.57(0.48, 0.67)), PPP3CA; PPP3R1 (P = 5.47E-07, OR = 0.66(0.57, 0.78)). Among them, ICAM1 was detected in both CSF and plasma proteins. By excluding reverse causality, confounding factors, and linkage disequilibrium (LD), we identified PPP3CA; PPP3R1 as novel drug targets for SLE, including Voclosporin and Cyclosporine. Finally, the Drugbank database shows that novel drugs contain 33 targets for treating SLE. PPI suggested that SIRT1, ACE, PTGS2, and BACE1 were pivotal targets for SLE treatment. In addition, the molecular docking showed that the bioactive molecules of Voclosporin and Cyclosporine had a good affinity with the target of SLE. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis suggested that levels of circulating PPP3CA; PPP3R1 had causal effects on SLE risk and served as potential treatment targets. Moreover, this study provides new evidence for Voclosporin as an SLE treatment through Mendelian randomization and Network pharmacology, and warrants further clinical investigation.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0316481'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIFlhbmFu', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Yanan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWmVsaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Zelin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhLCBUaWV3ZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Jia, Tiewen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-3656-354X', 'prefLabel': 'Liang, Shufen'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Exploring potential drug targets for SLE through Mendelian randomization and network pharmacology'],2025-03-20T14:40:39.610+0100,337.0

In aged people, it has been associated with female sex, poor general health, depression, functional and cognitive decline, and increased dependence levels, all of which are well-recognized characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases (RMDs). The objective was to describe the mistreatment phenomenon in Mexican patients with RMDs. We additionally report the adaptation and validation of the Geriatric Mistreatment Scale (GMS) in the target population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was developed in two phases (June 28, 2023-February 2, 2024), and three convenience samples were used: S-1 (n = 30), S-2 (n = 260), and S-3 (n = 372). Phase 1 consisted of adapting the GMS to RMDs (RMD-MS) (experts’ agreement), followed by RMD-MS face validity (pilot testing, S-1), content validity (experts’ agreement), concurrent criterion validity (family APGAR score ≤3, S-2), construct validity (exploratory factor analysis and convergent validity, S-2), reliability (internal consistency and temporal stability, S-2) and feasibility (in S-1). Phase 2 consisted of the mistreatment description in S-3. RESULTS: Patients represented typical RMD outpatients with substantial disease duration. There were 187 (50.3%) patients with overall mistreatment, and psychological was the most frequent in 142 (75.9%) patients, followed by neglect mistreatment in 96 (51.3%), sexual in 30 (16%), physical in 23 (12.3%), and economic mistreatment in 20 (10.7%) patients. Patients’ perceived mistreatment was related to the underlying RMD in 13.3% of sexual mistreatment and 53.3% of psychological mistreatment. The number of ""I do not want to answer"" responses raised to 21.7%-67.7% for abusers’ sex and 40%-72.9% for the abusers’ relationship with the participant. The RMD-MS was valid, reliable, and feasible.

frl:6511799,"['Counting the number of young in a brood from a distance is common practice, for example in tree-nesting birds. These counts can, however, suffer from over and undercounting, which can lead to biased estimates of fecundity (average number of nestlings per brood). Statistical model development to account for observation bias has focused on false negatives (undercounts), yet it has been shown that these models are sensitive to the presence of false positives (overcounts) when they are not accounted for. Here, we develop a model that estimates fecundity while accounting for both false positives and false negatives in brood counts. Its parameters can be estimated using a calibration approach that combines uncertain counts with certain ones, which can be obtained by accessing the brood, for example during ringing. The model uses multinomial distributions to estimate the probabilities of observing  y young conditional on the true state of a brood z (i.e., true number of young) from paired uncertain and certain counts. These classification probabilities are then used to estimate the true state of broods for which only uncertain counts are available. We use a simulation study to investigate bias and precision of the model and parameterize the simulation with empirical data from 26 red kite nests visited with ground and nest-based counts during 2021 and 2022 in central Europe. In these data, bias in counts was at most 1 in either direction, more common in larger broods, and undercounting was more common than overcounting. This led to an overall 5% negative bias in fecundity in uncertain counts. The model produced essentially unbiased estimates (relative bias < 2%) of fecundity across a range of sample sizes. This held true whether or not fecundity was the same  for nests with paired counts and those with uncertain-only counts. But the model could not estimate parameters when true states were missing from the paired data, which happened frequently in small sample sizes (n = 10 or 25). Further, we projected populations 50 years into the future using fecundity estimates corrected for observation biases from the multinomial model, and based on “raw” uncertain observations. We found that ignoring observation bias led to strong negative bias in projected population size for growing populations, but only minor negative bias in declining populations. Accounting for apparently minor biases associated with ground counts is important for ensuring accurate estimates of abundance and population dynamics especially for increasing populations. This could be particularly important for informing conservation decisions in projects aimed at recovering depleted populations.']",public,['4:e62'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sbG1hbm4sIFJhaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Sollmann, Rahel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWRlbm90LCBOYXRoYWxpZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Adenot, Nathalie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3Bha292c3preSwgUGV0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Spakovszky, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2luZHQsIEplbmRyaWs=', 'prefLabel': 'Windt, Jendrik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF0dHNzb24sIEJyYWR5IEou', 'prefLabel': 'Mattsson, Brady J.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Accounting for observation biases associated with counts of young when estimating fecundity: case study on the arboreal-nesting red kite (Milvus milvus)'],2025-06-12T07:47:59.308+0200,336.0

In order to gain insights into the molecular genetic background of these phenotypes, 998 fallow animals (772 brown, 62 black, 126 menil, and 38 white) were examined for mutations in the ASIP, MC1R, TYR, and SLC45A2 genes. In ASIP, two mutations (ASIP-M-E2, located at the boundary from exon 2 to intron 2; and ASIP-M-E3, an InDel of five nucleotides) were found, leading to black fallow deer being either homozygous or heterozygous in combination. There were also two mutations found in MC1R. Whereby the mutation MC1R-M1 (leucine to proline, L48P) homozygous leads to a white coat, while the mutation MC1R-M2 (glycine to aspartic acid, G236D) homozygous is associated with the menil phenotype. When both mutations occur together in a heterozygous character state, it results in a menil coat. Since the mutations in the two genes are only present alternatively, 36 genotypes can be identified that form color clusters to which all animals can be assigned.

The purpose of this study is to utilize the FAERS database and bibliometric analysis to examine adverse events associated with toripalimab in real-world settings, thereby enhancing the safety management of clinical medications.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nThis research implemented a disproportionality analysis to assess the safety of toripalimab by reviewing all adverse event reports from the FAERS database dating back to 2004, wherein toripalimab was recognized as the main suspected medication. Various statistical techniques were applied in the analysis, such as the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), to evaluate the adverse events linked to toripalimab. CiteSpace is utilized to search for authors, countries, keywords, and various indicators within research fields, facilitating the identification of research hotspots and future trends.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nFrom 2004 to 2024, 441 AEs linked to toripalimab were recorded across 27 SOCs. The top five SOCs were procedural complications, investigations, blood/lymphatic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and skin/subcutaneous disorders. At the PT level, the top five AEs by ROR were myelosuppression (n\u2009=\u2009192, ROR 687.41), decreased granulocyte count (n\u2009=\u200911, ROR 515.72), immune-mediated hepatic disorder (n\u2009=\u20097, ROR 343.20), immune-mediated myocarditis (n\u2009=\u20093, ROR 214.68), and bicytopenia (n\u2009=\u20093, ROR 117.49). Additionally, 91.62% of AEs occurred within the first 30 days, and immune-related AEs were highlighted in bibliometric analysis.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThis research provides initial safety information regarding the real-world application of toripalimab, affirming previously acknowledged adverse effects and concurrently uncovering new possible risks. These results could act as important cautionary evidence for healthcare professionals and pharmacists engaged in administering toripalimab for NPC.']",public,['20(6):e0326216'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBRaWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Qian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9uZywgRG9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Dong, Dong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFuZywgWmloYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Dang, Zihan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIFNodW1hbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Shuman'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWlhbywgWGluamll', 'prefLabel': 'Qiao, Xinjie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEJhaXF1YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Baiquan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-2886-8175', 'prefLabel': 'zhao, yulin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The adverse events of toripalimab in nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on FAERS database and bibliometric analysis'],2025-06-23T10:42:51.749+0200,317.0
frl:6510669,"['BACKGROUND: A three-antigen DNA-prime/chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) boost vaccine containing pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (CSP), Pf apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) and malaria multiple epitopes (ME) fused to Pf thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP) elicited higher vaccine efficacy (VE) in an open label, randomized Phase 1 trial against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) than the two-antigen vaccine DNA/Human Adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) containing CSP and AMA1. The objective of this follow-up study was to determine whether responses to CSP, AMA1 or TRAP MHC Class I-restricted epitopes were associated with VE. METHODOLOGY: Protected (n = 6) and non-protected participants (n = 26) were screened in FluoroSpot interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Granzyme B (GzB) assays using antigen-specific 15mer peptide subpools spanning CSP (n = 9 subpools), AMA1 (n = 12 subpools), and TRAP (n = 11 subpools). Individual antigen-specific 15mers in the subpools with strong responses were then deconvoluted, evaluated for activities, and MHC Class I-restricted epitopes within the active 15mers were predicted using NetMHCpan algorithms. The predicted epitopes were synthesized and evaluated in the FluoroSpot IFN-γ and GzB assays. RESULTS: Protected and some non-protected participants had similar responses to individual antigen-specific peptide subpools, which did not distinguish only protected participants. However, deconvoluted antigen-specific positive subpools with high magnitudes of responses revealed individual 15mer peptides containing specific and/or predicted MHC Class I (HLA) epitopes. Responses to epitopes were either IFN-γ-only, IFN-γ and GzB, or GzB-only. Due to limitation of cells, most of the analysis concentrated on the identification of protection associated AMA1 epitopes, since most of the predominant pool specific responses were generated against AMA1 15mer subpools. Furthermore, we previously identified protection associated HLA class I-restricted epitopes in a previous gene-based vaccine trial. Seven predicted minimal epitopes in AMA1 were synthesized and upon testing, five recalled responses from protected participants confirming their possible contribution and association with protection, and two recalled responses from non-protected participants. Two protection-associated epitopes were promiscuous and may have also contributed to protection by recognition of different HLA alleles. In addition, strongly positive antigen-specific 15mers identified within active antigen-specific subpools contained 39 predicted but not tested epitopes were identified in CSP, AMA1 and TRAP. Finally, some non-protected individuals recognized HLA-matched protection-associated minimal epitopes and we discuss possible reasons. Other factors such as HLA allele fine specificity or interaction between other HLA alleles in same individual may also influence protective efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated approach using immunoassays and bioinformatics identified and confirmed AMA1-MHC Class I-restricted epitopes and a list of predicted additional epitopes which could be evaluated in future studies to assess possible association with protection against CHMI in the Phase 1 trial participants. The results suggest that identification of protection-associated epitopes within malaria antigens is feasible and can help design potent next generation multi-antigen, multi-epitope malaria vaccines for a genetically diverse population and to develop robust assays to measure protective cellular immunity against pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria. This approach can be used to develop vaccines for other novel emerging infectious disease pathogens.\r\n']",public,['20(2):e0318098'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-8989-006X', 'prefLabel': 'Ganeshan, Harini'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIEp1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4103-6611', 'prefLabel': 'Belmonte, Maria'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVsbW9udGUsIEFybmVs', 'prefLabel': 'Belmonte, Arnel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SW5vdWUsIFNhbmRyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Inoue, Sandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVsYXNjbywgUmFjaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Velasco, Rachel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFpb2xhdGVzaSwgU2FudGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Maiolatesi, Santina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGltYmFjaCwgS2VpdGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Limbach, Keith'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGF0dGVyc29uLCBOb2VsbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Patterson, Noelle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2tsYXIsIE1hcnZpbiBKLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Sklar, Marvin J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29pc3NvbiwgTG9ycmFpbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Soisson, Lorraine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXBzdGVpbiwgSnVkaXRoIEUu', 'prefLabel': 'Epstein, Judith E.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWRnZWwsIEtpbWJlcmx5IEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Edgel, Kimberly A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0ZXJzLCBCam9lcm4=', 'prefLabel': 'Peters, Bjoern'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9sbGluZ2RhbGUsIE1pY2hhZWwgUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Hollingdale, Michael R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlsbGFzYW50ZSwgRWlsZWVu', 'prefLabel': 'Villasante, Eileen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHVwbGVzc2lzLCBDaHJpc3RvcGhlciBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Duplessis, Christopher A.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6385-508X', 'prefLabel': 'Sedegah, Martha'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Human responses to the DNA prime/chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) boost vaccine identify CSP, AMA1 and TRAP MHC Class I-restricted epitopes']",2025-03-14T12:02:22.981+0100,337.0
frl:6510695,"['BACKGROUND: Intestinal transplantation (ITx) represents the only curative option for patients with irreversible intestinal failure. Nevertheless, its rejection rate surpasses that of other solid organ transplants due to the heightened immunological load of the gut. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are key players in the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance, suggesting their potential involvement in modulating host vs. graft responses after ITx. Thus, we investigated the association of Tregs with allograft outcomes in pediatric patients and in an experimental model of small bowel transplantation. METHODS: Treg frequency in human samples was analyzed by Flow cytometry (CD4+CD25highCD127-, blood samples) and immunohistochemistry (FoxP3, graft samples). Experimental allogenic-heterotopic small bowel transplantation was performed in rats and animals divided into 3 groups: non-immunosuppressant treatment, rapamycin (2 mg/kg), and tacrolimus (0.6 mg/kg) treatment. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) was diagnosed based on clinical and histological findings, graft gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators assessed by RT-qPCR, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels by Luminex, and Treg frequency analyzed by flow cytometry (CD4+CD25highFoxP3+). RESULTS: Blood samples from patients undergoing ACR exhibited a significant reduction in the Treg number compared to those with normo-functional grafts. Similarly, a diminished number of FoxP3+ cells was observed in mucosa samples with ACR. In the experimental model, rapamycin-treated animals displayed clinical and histological findings resembling those not receiving immunosuppression treatment. Notably, ACR correlated with a high CD8/CD4 ratio, loss of T-cell chimerism, mRNA upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and diminished graft Treg frequency. In contrast, tacrolimus treatment prevented ACR and facilitate blood and graft Treg expansion. Remarkably, recipients who achieved Treg expansion within the graft remained free of ACR even after discontinuation of the immunosuppressant treatment and this phenomenon was associated with increased levels of serum IL-10. CONCLUSION: Our clinical and experimental findings underscore the association between Treg frequency and graft rejection after ITx, advocating for strategies that promote their expansion within the gut mucosa to enhance long-term outcomes.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0307534'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9020-2225', 'prefLabel': 'Papa Gobbi, Rodrigo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RyaW5nYSwgUGFibG8=', 'prefLabel': 'Stringa, Pablo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VudGlsaW5pLCBNYXJpYSBWaXJnaW5pYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Gentilini, Maria Virginia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXZhbm9mZiwgSXZhbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Ivanoff, Ivana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFjaHVjYSwgTWFyaWFuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Machuca, Mariana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJyZW9sYSwgTmlkaWEgTW9uc2VycmF0', 'prefLabel': 'Arreola, Nidia Monserrat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2VycmFkaWxsYSwgSmF2aWVy', 'prefLabel': 'Serradilla, Javier'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXN0ZWZhbsOtYS1GZXJuw6FuZGV6LCBLYXJsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Estefanía-Fernández, Karla'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFsYXllcm8sIFBhbG9tYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Talayero, Paloma'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVsYXlvcywgTWFyw61h', 'prefLabel': 'Velayos, María'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U8OhbmNoZXrigJRaYXBhcmRpZWwsIEVsZW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Sánchez—Zapardiel, Elena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29uZG9sZXNpLCBHYWJyaWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Gondolesi, Gabriel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW5kcsOpcy1Nb3Jlbm8sIEFuZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Andrés-Moreno, Ane'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVtYm8sIE1hcnRpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Rumbo, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVybsOhbmRlei1PbGl2ZXJvcywgRnJhbmNpc2Nv', 'prefLabel': 'Hernández-Oliveros, Francisco'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Low regulatory T-cells frequency is associated with graft rejection after small bowel transplantation: Clinical and experimental evidence'],2025-03-18T14:10:09.205+0100,337.0
frl:6510657,"['BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the first cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults. Primary and secondary progressive MS are still lacking effective treatments. A new nutraceutical product made of lyophilised leaves of bioengineered kiwi plants (Actinidia deliciosa) overexpressing osmotin has recently been developed. Osmotin is a protein associated with stress adaptation in plant cells and it shares anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties with mammalian adiponectin. The aim of this study is to explore the safety and the efficacy of osmotin in progressive MS (PMS). METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm interventional, baseline vs treatment study that will be carried out by two Italian MS centers, where a total of fifty PMS patients will be recruited. Every patient will take a daily dosage of 5 grams of an osmotin-based nutraceutical, named Forza™ (9th Dimension Biotech, Inc.), for 6 months. Two pre-treatment assessments, at -6 months (-6M) and at baseline visit (M0), and two post-treatment assessments, at month 1 (M1), and at month 6 (M6) will be carried out. ForzaTM safety and activity, assessed by serum Neurofilaments Light (NfL) Chain quantification, are the primary outcomes of the study. Additional assessments will consist of clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, patient reported outcomes (PROs), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). DISCUSSION: Disease modifying treatments in MS usually target inflammatory pathways with excellent results on reducing relapse associated disability but fail in preventing progression independent from relapse activity. This is a proof-of-concept study aimed at exploring the safety and the activity of an osmotin-based nutraceutical as an adjuvant treatment in PMS patients.\r\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on July 10th 2023 at www.clinicaltrials.gov having identifier NCT05937802.\r\n']",public,['20(2):e0311214'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29zdGEsIFZpb2xh', 'prefLabel': 'Costa, Viola'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx1YW4sIEtlbmRh', 'prefLabel': 'Aluan, Kenda'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoaWF2ZXR0aSwgSXJlbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Schiavetti, Irene'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFzb24sIENhdGVyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Bason, Caterina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlnbywgVGl6aWFuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Vigo, Tiziana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGV2ZXJhcm8sIEVsaXNh', 'prefLabel': 'Leveraro, Elisa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2Fib25hLCBDb3JyYWRv', 'prefLabel': 'Cabona, Corrado'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJhZGEsIFZhbGVyaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Prada, Valeria'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9073-1082', 'prefLabel': 'Costagli, Mauro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9jY2lhLCBWaW5jZW56byBEYW5pZWxl', 'prefLabel': 'Boccia, Vincenzo Daniele'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVnZ2llcm8sIEJydW5v', 'prefLabel': 'Ruggiero, Bruno'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2026-3572', 'prefLabel': 'Brichetto, Giampaolo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FsdmV0dGksIE1hcmNv', 'prefLabel': 'Salvetti, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29ybWFuaSwgTWFyaWEgUGlh', 'prefLabel': 'Sormani, Maria Pia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuY2FyZGksIEdpYW5sdWlnaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mancardi, Gianluigi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SW5nbGVzZSwgTWF0aWxkZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Inglese, Matilde'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmF0dGFnbGlhLCBNYXJpbyBBbGJlcnRv', 'prefLabel': 'Battaglia, Mario Alberto'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Study protocol: Exploratory trial of Forza™, an osmotin-based nutraceutical as adjuvant for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis']",2025-03-14T09:47:57.939+0100,337.0

Protective factors that were significantly associated with a reduced risk of early death included hysterectomy (OR\u2009=\u20090.13, P\u2009=\u20090.012), radical surgery (OR\u2009=\u20090.21, P\u2009<\u20090.001), radiation therapy (OR\u2009=\u20090.40, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and chemotherapy (OR\u2009=\u20090.31, P\u2009<\u20090.001). A preliminary nomogram model was demonstrated adequate predictive performance with AUC values of 0.89 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.91) in the training cohort and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91) in the validation cohort. The model’s predictive performance was further supported by the calibration and DCA analyses, suggesting its potential clinical utility. CONCLUSION: This study identified key risk factors for early cancer-specific mortality in patients with advanced endometrial cancer. The preliminary nomogram model holds promise for predicting early death risk and could be valuable in clinical practice.

frl:6510722,"['INTRODUCTION: Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most frequent and serious organic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autophagy, a new form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in a variety of renal diseases, but the relationship between autophagy and LN remains unelucidated. METHODS: We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in kidney tissues from 14 LN patients and 7 normal controls using the GSE112943 dataset. Key modules and their contained genes were identified utilizing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DE-ARGs) among DEGs, key module genes and autophagy-related genes (ARGs) were obtained by venn plot, and subjected to protein-protein interaction network construction. Two machine learning methods were applied to identify signature genes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to assess the accuracy of the signature genes. We also analyzed immune cell infiltration in LN. Additionally, the association between key genes and kidney diseases was predicted. Finally, key genes expression in kidney was verified by clinical samples and animal experiments. RESULTS: A total of 10304 DEGs were identified in GSE1129943 and 29 modules were identified in WGCNA. Among them, the brown module and coral 2 module exhibited significant correlation with LN (cor = 0.86, -0.84, p<0.001). Machine learning techniques identified 5 signature genes, but only 2 were validated in the external dataset GSE32591, namely MAP1LC3B (AUC = 0.920) and TNFSF10 (AUC = 0.937), which are involved in autophagy and apoptosis. Immune infiltration analysis suggested that these key genes may be associated with immune cell infiltration in LN. In addition, these genes have been linked to a variety of renal diseases, and their expression was verified in kidney tissues in LN patients and lupus mice. CONCLUSION: MAP1LC3B and TNFSF10 may be key autophagy-related genes in LN. These key genes have the potential to provide new insights into the molecular diagnosis and treatment of LN.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0318280'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFN1', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Su'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIFdlaXRhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Weitao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuZywgWWVsaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Tang, Yelin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4133-9751', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Xiaoqing'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Identification and validation of key autophagy-related genes in lupus nephritis by bioinformatics and machine learning'],2025-03-19T14:36:39.358+0100,337.0
frl:6510739,"['BACKGROUND: Lowering barometric pressure (LP) can exacerbate neuropathic pain. However, animal studies in this field are limited to a few conditions. Furthermore, although sympathetic involvement has been reported as a possible mechanism, whether the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis remains unknown. To address these issues, we investigated LP-induced hyperalgesia by focusing on the cumulative effect of LP and measuring plasma corticosterone levels as a marker of HPA axis activation in mice. METHODS. Mice with chronic constriction injury (CCI) were used in this study. For behavioral tests, two types of LP stimulation were adopted: a single LP at 20 hPa (Single LP) and three consecutive LPs at 20 hPa (3LPs). Twelve mice were used for each protocol. The no-pressure-change protocol was used as the control. The mechanical sensitivity was tested before and after LP stimulation using von Frey filaments (vF). For corticosterone measurements, six CCI and six intact mice were exposed to 3LPs (CCI-3LPs and INT-3LPs), and another six CCI and six intact mice were exposed to the no-pressure-change protocol (CCI-NP and INT-NP). Blood samples were collected immediately after exposure. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The number of paw elevations by vF before and after LP stimulation did not differ significantly in either the Single LP or the no-pressure-change protocol. For the 3LPs, the number of paw elevations after LP stimulation was significantly greater than before stimulation. Plasma corticosterone levels in the CCI-3LPs were significantly higher than those in CCI-NPs. In intact mice, there was no significant difference in plasma corticosterone levels between the INT-3LPs and INT-NPs. CONCLUSIONS: LP has a cumulative effect on neuropathic pain. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation may have an important relationship with LP-induced pain in mice.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0317767'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVyYWppbWEsIFl1a2k=', 'prefLabel': 'Terajima, Yuki'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8840-5149', 'prefLabel': 'Sato, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9581-7800', 'prefLabel': 'Inagaki, Hideaki'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VXNoaWRhLCBUYWthaGlybw==', 'prefLabel': 'Ushida, Takahiro'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The effects of lowering barometric pressure on pain behavior and the stress hormone in mice with neuropathic pain'],2025-03-20T14:33:54.404+0100,337.0

In this work, a workflow based on computational chemometrics was employed to assess the authenticity and biomarker search of five key Asteraceae species commonly employed in traditional medicine. The UHPLC-DAD-ESI/MS–MS phenolic profile of Asteraceae extracts was combined with the evaluation of several in vitro biological properties. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), chicoric acids, and flavonoid glycosides were reported as authenticity markers of Achillea millefolium, Taraxacum officinale, and Arnica montana, respectively. The integration of phenolic profile and in vitro bioactivities provide insights for the identification of trans 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-O-diCQA) and isorhamnetin glycosides as the major antioxidant agents in Asteraceae extracts, whereas several CQAs and caffeoyl-deoxy-octulopyranosonic acids have been reported as responsible for their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities.

Both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) have demonstrated efficacy in antibody deficiency. Comparative analyses of these two routes of administration are limited to nurse-administered IVIG and home therapy with self-administered SCIG. A third programmatic approach, SCIG administered by nurses in hospital-based outpatient infusion clinics, combines certain advantages of IVIG and home SCIG such as the provision of nursing support and the reduced risk of systemic reactions associated with the subcutaneous route. This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the viability and resource utilization of nurse-administered SCIG with IVIG in patients with antibody deficiency. We hypothesized that nurse-administered SCIG would require a similar amount of infusion clinic time per month as IVIG, despite more frequent dosing, due to shorter individual appointments, while maintaining high patient satisfaction. Information on infusion duration, time in the infusion chair, direct nursing time, and treatment satisfaction using the Life Quality Index was collected. Time measures for each patient were expressed as minutes/4 weeks to account for the more frequent dosing of nurse-administered SCIG compared to IVIG. We determined that the total time, infusion time, and nursing time needed to provide nurse-administered SCIG was comparable to IVIG. The more frequent dosing of SCIG was offset by the shorter times required per infusion. Patients reported favorable treatment satisfaction with both nurse-administered SCIG and IVIG. We conclude that nurse-administered SCIG may be a useful treatment modality for well-selected individuals.']",public,['20(1):e0316797'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-5874-2444', 'prefLabel': ', Darshee'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-4290-5764', 'prefLabel': 'Thota, Pranavi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Uml0Y2hpZSwgVGF5bG9y', 'prefLabel': 'Ritchie, Taylor'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFuYSwgSGVsaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Rana, Heli'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWluaGFzLCBSYW52aXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Minhas, Ranvir'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9vbGppLCBKYWxhbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Moolji, Jalal'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Uml0Y2hpZSwgQnJ1Y2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Ritchie, Bruce'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7612-6529', 'prefLabel': 'Adatia, Adil'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Feasibility and resource utilization of nurse-administered subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy in antibody deficiency: A cross-sectional study'],2025-02-25T14:34:59.904+0100,337.0

A large, FDA phase 2/3 controlled clinical trial of combination antimycobacterial antibiotic therapy for CD has been completed, and the report describing the trial is pending publication. The identification of MAP infection in CD patients will become increasingly important. Thus, it is desirable to develop MAP-based tests that accurately predict which CD patients have a MAP infection. A prospective, case-control laboratory test study of 199 subjects (61 CD patients and 138 non-CD controls) was performed using a panel of MAP antigens, including Hsp65, PknG, PtpA, CL1, and MAP IDEXX, which were measured under blind conditions in the plasma of the 199 subjects. Results showed that compared to any individual MAP antigen, combinations of antigens showed improved CD classification performance. For the Hsp65 antigen, the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), correct classification (CC), and area under the curve (AUC) were 59.02%, 58.70%, 38.71%, 76.42%, 59.3% and 0.606, respectively.

These included functional annotation, the establishment of a protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network and module, and the identification of hub genes via coexpression analysis. The final step involved the validation of target genes via clinical specimens. RESULTS: This study analyzed datasets from four GEO databases and identified 64 common DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes are predominantly associated with pathways related to immunity and signal transduction. Protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed complex interactions among these differentially expressed genes and highlighted several genes that may play pivotal roles in shared pathological mechanisms, namely, CCR5, CD4, IL6, CXCL13, FOXM1, CXCL9, and CXCL10.

frl:6499868,"['Infertility is a common disease affecting around 10-15% of all couples. In around one third of cases a male factor is the reason for the couple’s infertility. Azoospermia is the most severe phenotype of male infertility and affected individuals have no chance to reproduce in a natural way. However, they can decide to undergo a testicular biopsy with the aim of testicular sperm extraction. If sperm are gained through the biopsy, these can be used for a medically assisted reproduction. In recent years it was shown that a genetic analysis prior to the biopsy can help to predict the chances of successful sperm retrieval. A crucial gene for male fertility is TEX15. It is involved in the piRNA pathway, which consists of PIWI proteins and small non-coding PIWIinteraction RNAs (piRNAs). This pathway ensures that transposable elements (TEs), which are part of the genome of mammals, are suppressed. This is especially important in foetal germ cells, as these undergo a genetic reprogramming and de novo methylation. This procedure re-activates TEs. The piRNA pathway ensure targeted re-methylation of TE sites. TEX15 is likely involved in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), which ensures long term silencing of TEs. Genetic analyses in infertile men frequently reveal variants in TEX15, which are difficult to interpret. In many cases it remains unknown whether the detected variant is the cause of the man’s infertility. Using a reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells, we tested variants in TEX15 and analysed if the variants impair the function of TEX15 in silencing transposable elements. We found that the variants c.2709_2711del p.(Glu903del) and c.3319G>C p.(Ala1107Pro) did not influence TGS in vitro. In an independent approach, we looked for further genes, which might be involved in the piRNA pathway and associated with azoospermia. Previous experiments have shown that the piRNA factor MIWI2 associates with the protein HSP90AA1. Fittingly, we found the homozygous missense variant c.971G>A p.(Arg324Lys) in HSP90AA1 in an azoospermic man. We created a knock-out mouse line for Hsp90aa1 as well as a knock-in mouse line harbouring the variant found in the infertile man. Our analyses show that mice lacking HSP90AA1 show male specific infertility due to meiotic arrest predominantly at leptotene cell stage. However, HSP90AA1 is not crucial for methylation of TEs in mice as revealed by total RNA-sequencing and enzymatic methylationsequencing of mouse germ cells. Its function in the piRNA pathway is probably redundant with the highly similar HSP90AB1. Our experiments highlight HSP90AA1 as a novel gene associated with azoospermia in humans. If validated, this gene can be included into clinical diagnostic testing of infertile men. We are currently phenotyping the mouse line harbouring the variant found in the azoospermic man, which will likely enable us to describe the first (likely) pathogenic variant in HSP90AA1 in humans.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Wyrwoll, Margot Julia', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1129462145'}, {'prefLabel': 'University of Edinburgh.

frl:6526217,"[""Peganum harmala, a member of the Zygophyllaceae family, is known for its diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory properties. The mechanisms through which P.\u2009harmala polysaccharide (LTP) induces autophagy, however, remain largely unexplored. This study aims to elucidate the role of LTP in autophagy induction and its efficacy in mitigating inflammation within macrophages. Autophagosome formation was evaluated using GFP-LC3 vectors, and LC3-II levels induced by LTP were analyzed through laser scanning confocal microscopy. Western blotting assessed the expression of autophagy-related proteins and the phosphorylation state of p70S6K in NRK cells, treated both with and without LTP, alongside autophagy inducers and inhibitors. Additionally, RAW264.7 cells were treated with 1\u2009μg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by Western blotting and ELISA assays to quantify inflammatory markers. The study's outcomes demonstrate that LTP facilitates an increase in autophagic activity, as evidenced by the enhanced expression of LC3-II and reduced levels of p62 in both NRK and RAW264.7 macrophages. This effect is mediated through the activation of the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, without inhibiting the autophagosome–lysosome fusion process. In vitro experiments with RAW264.7 cells treated with 1\u2009μg/mL LPS showed that LTP markedly decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6. Our findings indicate that LTP effectively reduces inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages by promoting autophagy via an mTOR-dependent mechanism.""]",public,['13(1):e4501'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-6072-357X', 'prefLabel': 'Rejiepu, Manzeremu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlbiwgSnVu', 'prefLabel': 'Shen, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlhbmcsIEp1bnFpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Liang, Junqing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFpdGlrYWJpbGksIEFsYWlsaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Maitikabili, Alaili'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgSmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Jian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIExpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Ling'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3090-197X', 'prefLabel': 'Mi, Na'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Peganum harmala Polysaccharide Mitigates LPS-Induced Inflammatory Response in Macrophages by Activating Autophagy Pathway'],2025-09-23T13:08:53.566+0200,286.0

First, we identified candidate genes involved in the physiological response to cold shock by comparing gene expression in cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive lines. Second, we could map three quantitative trait loci (QTL) that together explained a substantial 64% of the variation in CCRT in the ancestral population. Last, molecular genome editing tools based on CRISPR/ Cas9 and PiggyBac systems, were established for the first time in D. ananassae to enable future functional studies of candidate genes, not only for cold stress tolerance. Phase 2 extended this work, motivated by debate about whether CCRT alone fully captures ecologically relevant cold tolerance. Further, experiments included cold acclimation and additional phenotypes. The key findings were that cold acclimation improves cold tolerance and dramatically alters gene expression, particularly in ionoregulatory tissues. Importantly, additional cold tolerance phenotypes, such as lethal time and cold shock mortality, were found not to correlate significantly with chill coma recovery time. This highlights that while CCRT is useful, studying multiple phenotypes provides a more complete understanding of cold tolerance. Further genomic analysis linked specific regions influencing CCRT to biological processes like muscle development and metabolism. Overall, this project advanced our knowledge of thermal adaptation in natural populations.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Grath, Sonja', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/141791853'}, {'prefLabel': 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2002585-3'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2007744-0'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/ger', 'label': 'Deutsch', 'prefLabel': 'Deutsch'}]",['Population genomics and environmental adaptation in Drosophila ananassae'],2025-02-04T22:11:53.069+0100,338.0

frl:6511922,"['In the STREEM project, wind energy transfer to trees and their response were analyzed using a distributed system of cameras, tilt sensors, and strain sensors. The aim was to quantify energy transfer at the crown periphery and its dissipation within the tree down to the roots. Although it was not possible to quantify wind-induced crown deformation to derive changes in the projected crown area, drag coefficient, and crown porosity, significant insights into windtree interactions were gained. In forests, costly wind speed measurements can be replaced or supplemented by inexpensive air pressure measurements. This method enables measurements in complex terrain, where setting up measurement towers is often neither feasible nor cost-effective. Using the effective wind load concept, the wind-induced tree response was calibrated with pulling tests, establishing a connection between tree-specific reactions and quasi-static wind loads, which primarily govern wind-induced tree reactions. The Tree Strain Sensor (TSS) complemented the Tree Motion Monitoring System (TreeMMoSys) and, for the first time, enabled continuous measurement of wind-induced tree response from the crown to the roots. Measurements on a freestanding European beech showed that the transferred flow energy is primarily distributed in the first bending vibration mode. The previously assumed exchange of elastic energy between different vibration modes was not confirmed. Higher bending vibration modes play a minor role in energy dissipation, and the sway measurement signal energy decreases linearly by 90 % from the crown to the roots. Studies on a ponderosa pine revealed that, in addition to bending, torsional vibrations also occur in trees but decrease significantly as wind load increases. Furthermore, a multi-camera system was developed to track targets within tree crowns. The findings from STREEM significantly enhance the understanding of wind-tree interactions and provide valuable input for the development of wind load models and the assessment of the stability of forest and urban trees.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Reiterer, Alexander', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/139978283'}, {'prefLabel': 'Schindler, Dirk', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1147423172'}, {'prefLabel': 'Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.

The B. macrantha plant was extracted with methanol. The obtained extracts were analyzed for phytochemical components using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) techniques. Biological activity was assessed using the MTT assay on the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, while miRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR. Pharmacokinetic properties were calculated using ADMETSAR3 software, and molecular interactions were investigated through AutoDock Vina simulations. GC–MS analysis of B. macrantha extract identified 42 volatile compounds, with 1S-α-pinene, humulene, and caryophyllene being the most abundant. HPLC-DAD analysis detected 18 bioactive compounds, including catechin, oleuropein, and rutin. The extract inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 0.8\u2009mg/mL. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-19, miR-20a, miR-126, and miR-200c miRNAs was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, while these miRNAs were downregulated in healthy cells. ADMET analysis revealed that α-pinene, caryophyllene, and catechin exhibited high bioavailability, absorption, and distribution properties, while oleuropein and rutin showed limited absorption and bioavailability. Molecular docking studies demonstrated the potential binding interactions of these compounds with key target proteins involved in cancer progression. Consequently, B. macrantha presents significant potential as a valuable natural source for cancer therapy through its anticancer activity, modulation of miRNA expression, and interaction with cancer-associated proteins.']",public,"['13(1,Spec.

frl:6511251,"['Viruses can induce significant functional and morphological changes in host cells. For single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ss(+)RNA) viruses, these changes often involve extensive remodeling of host cell membranes to form viral replication organelles. These specialized organelles create a protective environment for viral RNA replication while enabling selective exchange with the cytoplasm. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying formation and function of replication organelles remain poorly understood for most ss(+)RNA viruses. This study aimed to investigate macromolecular complexes associated with viral replication organelles using in situ cryo-electron tomography, focusing on murine norovirus (MNV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) as model systems. In human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells, a fluorescently labeled HCV-derived subgenomic replicon induced the formation of fluorescent foci, which corresponded to regions containing doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs) in reconstructed 3D tomograms. These DMVs likely represented HCV replication organelles. However, no distinct electron densities indicative of DMV-associated macromolecular complexes were detected. In murine microglial BV2 cells infected with MNV, 3D tomograms revealed a high abundance of singlemembrane vesicles (SMVs), potentially representing MNV replication organelles. These SMVs were often filled with filamentous electron densities but lacked distinct features indicative of macromolecular complexes. MNV particles, appearing either ""empty"" or ""filled,"" frequently aligned along the cytoplasmic side of SMVs. However, subtomogram averaging of viral particles did not reveal any direct connections with SMVs, leaving the significance of their spatial association unresolved. In conclusion, no electron densities indicative of macromolecular complexes could be observed in association with either HCV DMVs or MNV SMVs. / © 2025 The Author(s).

In particular, the concentrations of coagulation proteases (pM to nM) are much lower than their natural inactivator antithrombin (AT,\u2009~\u20093\u2009μM), suggesting the existence of other coordinators. In the current study, we found that transferrin (normal plasma concentration\u2009~40\u2009μM) interacts with fibrinogen, thrombin, factor XIIa (FXIIa), and AT with different affinity to maintain coagulation balance. Normally, transferrin is sequestered by binding with fibrinogen (normal plasma concentration\u2009~10\u2009μM) at a molar ratio of 4:1. In atherosclerosis, abnormally up-regulated transferrin interacts with and potentiates thrombin/FXIIa and blocks AT’s inactivation effect on coagulation proteases by binding to AT, thus inducing hypercoagulability. In the mouse model, transferrin overexpression aggravated atherosclerosis, whereas transferrin inhibition via shRNA knockdown or treatment with anti-transferrin antibody or designed peptides interfering with transferrin-thrombin/FXIIa interactions alleviated atherosclerosis. Collectively, these findings identify that transferrin is an important clotting regulator and an adjuster in the maintenance of coagulation balance and modifies the coagulation cascade.']",public,['30(2):119-132'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuZywgWGlhb3Blbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Tang, Xiaopeng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFpoaXll', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Zhiye'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFuZywgTWluZ3FpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Fang, Mingqian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuLCBZYWp1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Han, Yajun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgR2Fu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Gan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgU2hlbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Sheng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHVlLCBNaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Xue, Min'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFlheGlvbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yaxiong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIExp', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Li'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIEppYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Jian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgQmlxaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Biqing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXdhbmdpLCBKYW1lcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Mwangi, James'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THUsIFFpdW1pbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lu, Qiumin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHUsIFhpYW9waW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Du, Xiaoping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFpLCBSZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lai, Ren'}]",2019.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Transferrin plays a central role in coagulation balance by interacting with clotting factors'],2025-02-20T10:44:54.978+0100,337.0

METHODS: Dataset GSE100054 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD samples were identified. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted for the DEGs. The top 10 hub genes in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network were screened out and used to construct a support vector machine (SVM) model. The expression of the top 10 genes was then validated in another dataset, GSE46129, and a clinical patient cohort. RESULTS: A total of 333 DEGs were identified. The DEGs were clustered into two gene sets that were significantly enriched in 12 pathways, of which 8 were significantly deregulated in PD, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, gap junction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation. The signature of the top 10 hub genes in the PPI network was used to construct the SVM model, which had high performance for predicting PD. Of the 10 genes, GP1BA, GP6, ITGB5, and P2RY12 were independent risk factors of PD. CONCLUSION: Genes such as GP1BA, GP6, P2RY12, and ITGB5 play critical roles in PD pathology through pathways including cytokine−cytokine receptor interaction, gap junctions, and actin cytoskeleton regulation.']",public,['48(10)'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlbiwgSnVu', 'prefLabel': 'Shen, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgWGlhby1DaGFuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Xiao-Chang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFdhbmctSnVu', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Wang-Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuLCBRaXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Han, Qiu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgQ2h1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Chun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THUsIEppbmctTWlu', 'prefLabel': 'Lu, Jing-Min'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhlbmcsIEppbi1ZdQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zheng, Jin-Yu'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9178-0433', 'prefLabel': 'Xue, Shouru'}]",2020.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Identification of Parkinson’s disease-related pathways and potential risk factors'],2025-02-20T09:07:01.082+0100,337.0

Between 3 March 2020 and 18 December 2021 the local public health agency ordered 24 603 isolations (9.2 per 100 inhabitants) and 45 014 quarantines (17 per 100 inhabitants) in a population of 266 123. The mean contacts per case was 1.9. More days of quarantine per 100 inhabitants were ordered for children than for adults: 4.1 for children aged 0-6, 5.2 for children aged 7-17, 0.9 for adults aged 18-64 and 0.3 for senior citizens aged 65-110. The mean duration for isolation orders was 10.2 and for quarantine orders 8.2 days. We calculated a delay of 4 days between contact and quarantine order. 3484 contact persons were in quarantine when they developed an infection. This represents 8% of all individuals in quarantine and 14% of those in isolation. Our study quantifies isolation and quarantine orders, shows that children had been ordered to quarantine more than adults and that there were fewer school days lost to isolation or quarantine as compared to school closures. Our results indicate that the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute had an influence on isolation and quarantine duration as well as contact identification and that the local public health agency was not able to provide rigorous contact tracing, as the mean number of contacts was lower than the mean number of contacts per person known from literature.

A.\u2009indica fruit was extracted with a hydroethanolic (70% v/v) solution, filtered, concentrated on a rotary evaporator and crude extract was obtained. In vitro anti-inflammatory potential of A.\u2009indica was carried out against peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a whole blood assay (WBA). Effects of A.\u2009indica extracts on proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-1β) and inflammatory mediators (NF-κB, NO and PGE2) concentration in the supernatant of PBMCs and WBA were evaluated using commercial ELISA kits. In vivo anti-inflammatory potential of A.\u2009indica hydroethanolic extract was evaluated with carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. A total of 36 different compounds (mostly phenolics) were detected in A.\u2009indica extract with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UHPCL-QTOF-MS/MS. The extract showed very low cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 483.68\u2009μg/mL and significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in both PBMCs and WBA models. Furthermore, the extract also effectively inhibited the paw edema by carrageenan in the 2nd hour at 400\u2009mg/kg (73%). Histopathological analysis of rat paw tissue showed significant reduction of cellular infiltration and decrease in swelling of epidermis and dermis by A.\u2009indica extracts.

Here, the methanolic and water extracts of T. coelesyriacus were obtained from its aboveground parts (stem, leaves, and flowers), and the phytochemical potentials were investigated by LC-HRMS (liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry) analysis for the first time. The antibacterial, antifungal, and anticarcinogenic activities of T. coelesyriacus extracts were investigated using experimental and in silico methods. T. coelesyriacus methanol extract revealed remarkable inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia (MICs\u2009=\u20090.83, 1.67, and 1.67\u2009mg/mL, respectively) compared to Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC\u2009=\u200953.3\u2009mg/mL). Inhibitory effects of T. coelesyriacus methanolic extracts were also observed in all Candida species tested, with the highest inhibition on Candida krusei (MIC\u2009=\u20090.83\u2009mg/mL), whereas no inhibitory effect was identified from the water extract. Additionally, both T. coelesyriacus methanolic (IC50\u2009=\u200986\u2009μg/mL) and water (IC50\u2009=\u200992\u2009μg/mL) extracts revealed significant selective anticarcinogenic effects on AR42J pancreatic cancer cells. HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells were, however, more resilient to methanol and water extract, respectively. In silico analyses further elucidated the noteworthy antibacterial potential of keracyanin chloride on S. aureus MurB enzyme and the remarkable inhibitory potential of naringin on FYN kinase specific for pancreatic cancer (AR42J) development. In conclusion, T. coelesyriacus phytochemicals with antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer properties were revealed for the first time, and molecular docking studies on potential targets confirmed good agreement with experimental findings. Therefore, the current studies on T. coelesyriacus provide the basis for investigating new pharmaceutical potentials of other Tragopogon members.']",public,['12(10):7252-7272'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8655-2716', 'prefLabel': 'Unver, Tuba'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5308-3730', 'prefLabel': 'UZUNER, UGUR'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9558-7048', 'prefLabel': 'Celik Uzuner, Selcen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7017-2447', 'prefLabel': 'Gürhan, İsmet'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-7527-6307', 'prefLabel': 'SİVRİ, NUR SENA'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4559-2305', 'prefLabel': 'Özdemir, Zeynep'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Elucidating the antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic potential of methanolic and water extracts of edible Tragopogon coelesyriacus Boiss.'],2025-01-28T12:08:27.444+0100,286.0

However, animal models accounting for the interindividual variability in stress vulnerability are largely lacking. Moreover, the pervasive bias of using mostly male animals in preclinical studies poorly reflects the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in women. Using the threat imminence continuum theory, we designed and validated an auditory aversive conditioning-based pipeline in both female and male mice. We operationalised trait anxiety by harnessing the naturally occurring variability of defensive freezing responses combined with a model-based clustering strategy. While sustained freezing during prolonged retrieval sessions was identified as an anxiety-endophenotype behavioral marker in both sexes, females were consistently associated with an increased freezing response. RNA-sequencing of CeA, BLA, ACC, and BNST revealed massive differences in phasic and sustained responders’ transcriptomes, correlating with transcriptomic signatures of psychiatric disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, we detected significant alterations in the excitation/inhibition balance of principal neurons in the lateral amygdala. These findings provide compelling evidence that trait anxiety in inbred mice can be leveraged to develop translationally relevant preclinical models to investigate mechanisms of stress susceptibility in a sex-specific manner.']",public,['22(5):e3002642'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0210-0550', 'prefLabel': 'Kovlyagina, Irina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2llcmN6ZWlrbywgQW5uYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wierczeiko, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9kb3JvdiwgSHJpc3Rv', 'prefLabel': 'Todorov, Hristo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFjb2JpLCBFcmlj', 'prefLabel': 'Jacobi, Eric'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGV2b3NpYW4sIE1hcmdhcml0YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Tevosian, Margarita'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dm9uIEVuZ2VsaGFyZHQsIEpha29i', 'prefLabel': 'von Engelhardt, Jakob'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VyYmVyLCBTdXNhbm5l', 'prefLabel': 'Gerber, Susanne'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THV0eiwgQmVhdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Lutz, Beat'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Leveraging interindividual variability in threat conditioning of inbred mice to model trait anxiety'],2025-01-29T08:13:55.630+0100,336.0

This causal parameter is formalized as the effect on an outcome event of a (possibly hypothetical) intervention on the intensity of a treatment process. To establish identifiability, we propose novel graphical rules indicating whether the observed information is sufficient to obtain the desired causal effect by suitable reweighting. This requires a different type of graph than in discrete time. We formally define causal semantics for the corresponding dynamic graphs that represent local independence models for multivariate counting processes. Importantly, our work highlights that causal inference from censored data relies on subtle structural assumptions on the censoring process beyond independent censoring; these can be verified graphically. Put together, our results are the first to establish graphical rules for nonparametric causal identifiability in event processes in this generality for the continuous-time case, not relying on particular parametric survival models.

We administered four biologically active peptide solutions to spontaneously hypertensive rats: derived from corn, wheat, egg white, and soybean. The efficacy of these peptides in reducing blood pressure was assessed through regular measurements of systolic pressure. Additionally, we analyzed levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin 2 using immunohistochemistry and ELISA in vivo. The indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertensive rats were evaluated using qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.

Only the corn peptide showed a significant increase in transcript levels of the proinflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α.

frl:6510748,"['BACKGROUND: Research priority setting (RPS) studies are necessary to close the significant gap between the scientific evidence produced and the evidence stakeholders need. Their findings can make resource allocation in research more efficient. However, no general framework for conducting an RPS study among public health stakeholders exists. RPS studies in public health are rare and no such study has been previously conducted and published in Germany. Therefore, we aimed to investigate which research topics in public health are prioritised by relevant stakeholders in Germany. METHODS: Our RPS study consisted of a scoping stage and a Delphi stage each split into two rounds. Firstly, we invited members of the German Public Health Association to gather expert insights during two initial workshops. Next, we defined the relevant stakeholder groups and recruited respondents. Thereafter, we collected research topics and assessment criteria with the respondents in the first Delphi round and aggregated the responses through content analysis. Finally, we asked the respondents to rate the research topics with the assessment criteria in the second Delphi round. RESULTS: In total, 94 out of the 140 invited public health organisations nominated 230 respondents for the Delphi study of whom almost 90% participated in both Delphi rounds. We compiled a comprehensive list of 76 research topics that were rated and ranked by several assessment criteria. We split the research topics into two types, substantive research topics and methodological-theoretical research topics respectively, to ensure the comparability among the research topics. In both types of research topics—substantive research topics and methodological-theoretical research topics—the respective top five ranked research topics hardly differed between public health researchers and public health practitioners. However, clear differences exist in the priority ranking of many (non-top priority) research topics between the stakeholder groups. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that it is possible, with limited resources, to prioritise research topics for public health at the national level involving a wide range of pertinent stakeholders. The results can be used by research funding institutions to initiate calls for research projects with an increased relevance for health and/or scientific progress.']",public,['21(1):86'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0677-2063', 'prefLabel': 'Hoekstra, Dyon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VyaGFyZHVzLCBBbnNnYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Gerhardus, Ansgar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGhhY2hpbWksIFN0ZWZhbiBLLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lhachimi, Stefan K.'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Priority setting to support a public health research agenda: a modified Delphi study with public health stakeholders in Germany'],2025-03-21T10:01:29.480+0100,266.0
frl:6510685,"['INTRODUCTION: Unpaid care work is mainly performed by women, whose mental health is more affected by caregiving burden and work-family conflict compared to men. COVID-19 containment measures may have exacerbated existing gender inequalities in both unpaid care work and adverse mental health outcomes. This scoping review provides an overview of recent evidence on the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on unpaid care work and mental health for subgroups of caregivers at the intersection of gender and other social differences (e.g., ethnicity, age, class) in Europe. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our study was informed and guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework. We searched six academic databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, CINAHL, Social Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, ASSIA) and hand-searched the reference lists of selected articles to identify relevant peer-reviewed research articles published between 1 March 2020 and 7 September 2022. In addition, we conducted a grey literature search using Google Scholar and a targeted hand search on known international and European websites. We included studies that reported gender-disaggregated results on unpaid care work and mental health in the context of COVID-19 containment measures in Europe. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and full texts for eligibility and extracted the relevant data. The results were synthesised narratively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results suggest a greater gender gap in unpaid care work division and, to a lesser extent, in mental health, which is unfavourable towards women and mothers. Despite this, we see a break in the traditional division of childcare, with fathers taking on a greater role in family work, which makes us optimistic about the division of care work in the post-COVID-19 era. This research also shows that among European women, population groups often understudied, such as women who are single parents, disabled or of colour, have the highest increase in unpaid care work and greatest deterioration in wellbeing.']",public,['19(8):e0308381'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1097-9609', 'prefLabel': 'Gencer, Hande'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnJ1bm5ldHQsIFJlZ2luYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Brunnett, Regina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RhaWdlciwgVG9iaWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Staiger, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGV6Y2FuLUfDvG50ZWtpbiwgSMO8cnJlbQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Tezcan-Güntekin, Hürrem'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9274-6285', 'prefLabel': 'Pöge, Kathleen'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Caring is not always sharing: A scoping review exploring how COVID-19 containment measures have impacted unpaid care work and mental health among women and men in Europe'],2025-03-18T11:23:54.003+0100,266.0

Techniques that can overcome this problem are needed. Recent focus has been placed on employing organic substances like humic acid (HA) and amino acids, including L-tryptophan (L-TRP), to mitigate the negative effects of salt stress on cultivated plants. Accordingly, in this research, the impact of foliar applications of HA and L-TRP, both separately and combined, on the growth parameters and biochemical properties of spinach subjected to salt stress was investigated. In the present study, eight treatments (1. control, 2. salt (NaCl), 3. HA, 4. L-TRP, 5. HA\u2009+\u2009NaCl, 6. L-TRP\u2009+\u2009NaCl, 7. HA\u2009+\u2009L-TRP, and 8. HA\u2009+\u2009L-TRP\u2009+\u2009NaCl) were investigated. The study showed that salt stress markedly reduced several growth properties in spinach, including plant height, number of leaves, leaf dimensions, and both fresh and dry weight. Additionally, it significantly lowered contents of chlorophyll (a, b, and total), carotenoid, polyphenol, lutein, anthocyanin, polyphenol oxidase, glycine betaine, relative water content, and the antioxidant enzyme activities (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase). On the other hand, significant increases were observed in sodium, chlorine, potassium, sulfur, zinc, nickel, proline, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide levels of spinach with salinity. Individual and combined applications of HA and L-TRP positively influenced plant growth, relative water content, activities of antioxidant enzyme, chlorophyll, and mineral contents of spinach under both normal and saline conditions. In conclusion, the combined use of HA and L-TRP under salt stress conditions is promising in mitigating the negative impacts of salinity and can be suggested as an effective alternative approach for cultivating spinach in saline environments.']",public,['12(10):8324-8339'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5753-0390', 'prefLabel': 'turfan, nezahat'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9253-5747', 'prefLabel': 'Kibar, Beyhan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-6913-402X', 'prefLabel': 'DAVLETOVA, NAZAKAT'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-4547', 'prefLabel': 'Kibar, Hakan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Ameliorative effects of humic acid and L-tryptophan on enzyme activity, mineral content, biochemical properties, and plant growth of spinach cultivated in saline conditions']",2025-03-27T11:27:57.125+0100,286.0

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) characterization showed that the CMFs were successfully isolated from the leaves with high purity. The extracted CMFs had a particle size ranging from 321.20\u2009nm to 632.26\u2009nm and negative zeta potential values (−27.33 to −21.40). The extraction yield of CMFs ranged from 19.53% to 26.00%.

This study aimed to enhance dietary fiber extraction from the selected barley varieties (Jou-17, Sultan-17, and Pearl-21) using the ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) technique. This process involved washing, drying, de-fatting (using ethanol as green solvent), and protein removal steps. The response surface methodology (RSM) technique was used to optimize the yield of soluble dietary fiber (SDF; β-glucan) with time, temperature, and power. Optimal conditions yielded the highest SDF (5.21%) in all selected varieties after 17.5\u2009min at 41.70°C with 130.5\u2009W. FTIR pattern confirmed the functional group in the tested sample. TGA and DSC spectra determined the thermal of SDF (β-glucan). Monosaccharide composition confirmed that SDF (β-glucan) is glucose in nature. Proximate analysis indicated that Jou-17 had the highest moisture (13.4%) and crude fiber (10.10%) content. Sultan-17, on the other hand, had the maximum levels of ash (2.75%), crude fat (1.22%), and protein (8.84%). The NFE, water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, and foaming capacity of extracted SDF (β-glucan) in the “Pearl-21” barley variety were determined to be 78.37%, 14.07\u2009g/g, 6.99\u2009g/g, and 126.17%, whereas highest foaming-stability (96.26%) was observed in Jou-17 variety.

In a nutshell, optimizing the extraction of SDF (β-glucan) from the selected barley varieties using green technology and its favorable properties opens up promising paths for future endeavors and contributes to the advancement of sustainable and health-conscious practices in the food industry.']",public,['12(10):8394-8407'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW5pcywgTm9tZWVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Anis, Nomeena'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8022-8811', 'prefLabel': 'ahmed, Zaheer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbGlkLCBOYXVtYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Khalid, Nauman'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Optimization of ultrasonic-assisted extraction of soluble dietary fiber (β-glucan) from different barley varieties and study of its characterization and functional attributes'],2025-04-02T13:14:28.223+0200,286.0
frl:6489614,"[""This study investigates the role of positive cognitive reappraisal (PCR) flexibility and variability in mental health in response to real-life stressors among college students. We employed ecological momentary assessment and intervention through ReApp, a mobile app designed to train and promote PCR. We analyzed data from the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial with a total of 100 participants who used ReApp for three weeks. Stressors due to health problems, uncomfortable environment (e.g., rainy weather, crowded buses, etc.), and lack of time were reported most frequently. Stressors related to the war in Ukraine, fear of the future, exams, and COVID-19 were reported as the most severe. To reappraise these stressors, the participants used mostly acceptance and problem-solving tactics. A key finding is the role of emotional demand-dependent PCR flexibility in mental health. Specifically, the flexible adaptation of PCR tactics in response to stressor severity was associated with a more substantial decline in perceived stress over the study period among participants reporting low tendency to use PCR at the study's baseline (β\xa0=\xa0- 0.963, p\xa0=\xa0.016, Cohen's f\xa0=\xa00.26). In contrast, stressor domain-dependent flexibility and contextually independent between-tactic variability had no moderating effect on stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. This study contributes to the field of emotion regulation flexibility by highlighting the adaptive role of emotional demand-dependent PCR flexibility in mental well-being among young adults navigating real-life stressors and underscores the importance of tailoring interventions based on the emotional demands of stressors.""]",public,['183:104653'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFyY2luaWFrLCBNYXJ0YSBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Marciniak, Marta A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9tYW4sIFN0ZXBoYW5pZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Homan, Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVyYmFuLCBNYXR0aGlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zerban, Matthias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NocmFkZSwgR2VzaW5l', 'prefLabel': 'Schrade, Gesine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVlbiwgS2VubmV0aCBTLkwu', 'prefLabel': 'Yuen, Kenneth S.L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29ieWxpbnNrYSwgRG9yb3Rh', 'prefLabel': 'Kobylinska, Dorota'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2llc2VyLCBNYXR0aGlhcyBKLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wieser, Matthias J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FsdGVyLCBIZW5yaWs=', 'prefLabel': 'Walter, Henrik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVybWFucywgRXJubyBKLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hermans, Erno J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhbmFoYW4sIExpbGx5', 'prefLabel': 'Shanahan, Lilly'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FsaXNjaCwgUmFmZmFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Kalisch, Raffael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xlaW0sIEJpcmdpdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Kleim, Birgit'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Positive cognitive reappraisal flexibility is associated with lower levels of perceived stress'],2025-01-29T08:19:21.769+0100,336.0

In a longitudinal behavioral analysis, we found premature decline of hippocampus-based cognitive functions together with a significant reduction of immediate early gene (IEG) expression. While we did not detect any morphological changes of hippocampal projections and synaptic contacts, molecular markers of neurodegeneration were increased and the mTOR signaling cascade was downregulated in hippocampal synaptosomes. Injection of IGF2, a molecule that induces mTOR signaling, could fully rescue cognitive impairment and IEG expression in aging Tsc2+/− animals.

Reports of low reliability for experimental measures of cognitive biases have called into question previous findings on the association of these measures with markers of mental health and demonstrated the need to systematically evaluate measurement reliability for measures of cognitive biases. We evaluated reliability and correlations with self-report measures of mental health for interpretation bias scores derived from the Ambiguous Cue Task (ACT), an experimental paradigm for the assessment of approach-avoidance behavior towards ambiguous affective stimuli. For a non-clinical sample, the measurement of an interpretation bias with the ACT showed high internal consistency (rSB = .91 – .96, N = 354) and acceptable 2-week test–retest correlations (rPearson = .61 – .65, n = 109). Correlations between the ACT interpretation bias scores and mental health-related self-report measures of personality and well-being were generally small (r ≤ |.11|) and statistically not significant when correcting for multiple comparisons. These findings suggest that in non-clinical populations, individual differences in the interpretation of ambiguous affective information as assessed with the ACT do not show a clear association with self-report markers of mental health. However, in allowing for a highly reliable measurement of interpretation bias, the ACT provides a valuable tool for studies considering potentially small effect sizes in non-clinical populations by studying bigger samples as well as for work on clinical populations, for which potentially greater effects can be expected.']",public,['56(7):7774-7789'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJtYnJ1c3Rlci1HZW7DpywgRGlhbmEgSi4gTi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Armbruster-Genç, Diana J.

Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (LR) is a probiotic that does not exhibit adequate stability under harsh conditions. To enhance the survival capacity of LR during gastrointestinal storage, alginate (ALG) was used as a primary encapsulating layer through extrusion microencapsulation. Subsequently, camelina seed mucilage (CSM) and camelina seed protein (CSP) were applied as secondary layers at varying concentrations (0%–4%). Among the tested formulations, ALG-CSM-CSP (1.5%, 4%, 4% w/w) exhibited significantly higher encapsulation efficiency (94.15%) and provided appropriate LR encapsulation in SEM image. Three saffron milk desserts (SMD) containing free LR (FLR), microencapsulated LR (MLR), and a control (C) were prepared, followed by physicochemical and microbiological assessments of the samples. The result showed that at the end of storage, SMD had the lowest pH (6.21), the highest acidity (30°D), and maintained the permissible limit of probiotic bacteria (6.7 log cfu/mL) among the samples.

We present a systematic review of 127 discrete choice experiment (DCE) studies of farmers' preferences with respect to agri-environmental contracts. DCE studies evaluate two central features of farmers' behaviour: (1) their willingness to accept land use prescriptions, such as fertiliser use, application of pesticides, restrictions on cropping, livestock management, integration of silvopasture, maintaining soil health or water use restrictions; and (2) their responses to variations in incentive and commitment criteria, such as reward schemes, monitoring regimes, technical assistance, flexibility of agreements, administrative burden and collaborative implementation. Our analysis considers how these different elements are interlinked and applied in experiments to simulate farmers' decision-making processes. We examine recent methodological improvements in explaining farmer behaviour, including the accommodation of preference heterogeneity, the combining of discrete (enrolment) and continuous decisions, and the incorporation of farmers' sense of identity. DCEs have been applied for the ex ante analysis of different policy instruments to inform the European Common Agricultural Policy and agri-environmental schemes outside the EU. The results of this systematic review may be useful in informing the future design of such agri-environmental programmes. The database underpinning this systematic literature review may help peer scientists to (a) compare, validate and triangulate their own findings with respect to other experimental approaches, (b) use previous willingness-to-accept (WTA) measures as priors for their own study design, and (c) identify research gaps regarding farmers' preferences for agri-environmental measures.""]",public,['75(1):44-83'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6ZSwgQ2hyaXN0b3Bo', 'prefLabel': 'Schulze, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmFnw7Nyc2thLCBLYXRhcnp5bmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Zagórska, Katarzyna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SMOkZm5lciwgS2F0aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Häfner, Kati'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFya2lld2ljeiwgT2xpbXBpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Markiewicz, Olimpia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3phamtvd3NraSwgTWlrb8WCYWo=', 'prefLabel': 'Czajkowski, Mikołaj'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF0emRvcmYsIEJldHRpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Matzdorf, Bettina'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","[""Using farmers' ex ante preferences to design agri-environmental contracts: A systematic review""]",2025-05-14T14:45:41.944+0200,333.0

The assessment of agronomic practices across agroecological zones (AEZs) is limited by inadequate data quality, hindering a precise evaluation of maize yield on a large scale. In this study, we employed the DSSAT-CERES-Maize crop model (where CERES is Crop Environment Resource Synthesis and DSSAT is Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) to investigate the impacts of different agronomic practices on maize yield across different AEZs in two counties of Kenya. The model was calibrated and evaluated with observed grain yield, biomass, leaf area index, phenology, and soil water content from 2-year experiments. Remote sensing (RS) images derived from the Sentinel-2 satellite were integrated to delineate maize areas, and the resulting information was merged with DSSAT-CERES-Maize yield simulations. This facilitated a comprehensive quantification of various agronomic measures at pixel scales. Evaluation of agronomic measures revealed that sowing dates and cultivar types significantly influenced maize yield across the AEZs. Notably, AEZ II and AEZ III exhibited elevated yields when implementing combined practices of early sowing and cultivar H614. The impacts of optimal management practices varied across the AEZs, resulting in yield increases of 81, 115, and 202 kg ha−1 in AEZ I, AEZ II, and AEZ III, respectively. This study underscores the potential of the CERES-Maize model and high-resolution RS data in estimating production at larger scales. Furthermore, this integrated approach holds promise for supporting agricultural decision-making and designing optimal strategies to enhance productivity while accounting for site-specific conditions.']",public,['7(1):e20478'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lwa3VsZWksIEhhcmlzb24gS2lwbGFnYXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Kipkulei, Harison Kiplagat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVsbGluZ3JhdGgtS2ltdXJhLCBTb25va28gRG9yb3RoZWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Bellingrath-Kimura, Sonoko Dorothea'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuYSwgTWFyY29z', 'prefLabel': 'Lana, Marcos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2hhemFyeWFuLCBHb2hhcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ghazaryan, Gohar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/IEJhYXR6LCBSb2xhbmQ=', 'prefLabel': ' Baatz, Roland'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF0YXZlbCwgQ3VzdG9kaW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Matavel, Custodio'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9pdHQsIE1hcms=', 'prefLabel': 'Boitt, Mark'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hpc2FuZ2EsIENoYXJsZXMgQi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Chisanga, Charles B.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um90aWNoLCBCcmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Rotich, Brian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZWlyYSwgUm9kcmlnbyBNYXJ0aW5z', 'prefLabel': 'Moreira, Rodrigo Martins'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYmVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Agronomic management response in maize (Zea mays L.) production across three agroecological zones of Kenya'],2025-05-14T13:43:12.336+0200,333.0

To close this gap, this study presents a low-cost NDVI sensor priced under €250, offering an affordable yet high-accuracy crop monitoring tool. The device has dual functionality, operating in both manual (handheld) and automatic (standalone) modes, enabling continuous crop monitoring with higher temporal resolution and reduced labor costs. This study also identified and corrected the underestimation of measurements at higher NDVI values through sensor calibration. Subsequent field validation proved the accuracy of the low-cost sensor, showing a generally good overall agreement with results obtained with the reference sensor (r² = 0.99) after applying the derived calibration function. Extended field trials in Benin and the Philippines demonstrated the reliability of the device to adequately monitor treatment differences in various crop development and biomass accumulation. Further customization into automatic mode enabled continuous, high-frequency NDVI measurements, showing its ability to monitor crop phenological changes, such as senescence, in an additional field testing in Germany. Overall, this study demonstrates that the developed NDVI sensor device, made from affordable, off-the-shelf components, can be adapted into a scientifically usable NDVI sensor that is accurate, reliable, and cost-effective.

Adaptation efforts will be ineffective unless farmers' perspectives of climate change are understood. The objectives are to examine smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate risk, identify their adaptation strategies, and examine the factors that influence the adoption of these adaptation strategies at farm and off-level. Data were collected from 420 smallholder farmers across three regions of rural Gambia using a survey and multistage sampling technique. Binary logistic and multivariate probit models were used to analyse the determinants of farmers' decision to adopt adaptation strategies. The empirical result of the binary logistic model indicates that land tenure, access to government support, access to markets, witness to extreme weather events, and climate change perception influenced farmers' choice to adopt adaptation measures. The findings further indicate that female farmers are less likely to adopt adaptation measures. However, the multivariate probit model revealed that age, education, access to extension services, membership of farm groups, and perceived climate change are the main determinants of on-farm adaptation strategies. Off-farm strategies such as petty business are mainly influenced by being female, middle age, and primary education. The results suggest that gender-disaggregated support and targeted policies are necessary to encourage the adoption of adaptation strategies among female farmers.

In addition to mitigating climate change, CF measures provide co-benefits through the supply of additional ecosystem services (ES). Integrating such benefits into a comprehensive assessment may increase the attractiveness of CF measures, increase adoption rates, and ultimately benefit climate and ecosystems. However, site-specific and measure-specific characteristics influence the impacts of CF measures. A comprehensive overview over CF impacts is lacking. We therefore analyzed six CF measures on cropland in the European temperate zone: (1) cover cropping, (2) introducing legumes or semi-perennial crops into crop rotations, (3) conversion to short rotation coppice, (4) agroforestry, (5) afforestation of marginal cropland, and (6) partial rewetting of drained organic soils. Through a structured literature review, we derived on-site climate change mitigation potentials, impacts on the supply of ES, and economic trade-offs, as well as influencing factors causing spatial heterogeneities. Our results show that the climate change mitigation potential varies strongly between and within CF measures. All measures can boost the supply of regulating ecosystem services, while trade-offs exist mainly with provisioning services and economic returns. Spatially heterogeneous effects in ES supply depend on local ES demand. As proof of concept, we mapped expected beneficial ES effects from 4 selected ES positively impacted by the measure (4) agroforestry in a GIS environment for Germany, as well as opportunity costs as an economic trade-off. The results suggest that strong co-benefits can be expected in areas where opportunity costs are high. Moreover, the CF measures with the highest climate change mitigation potential also imply the highest systemic change of the farm system. This constitutes a strong economic hurdle to implementation. We argue that payments for ES are needed to incentivize CF adoption and harness the beneficial effects on climate and ecosystems. Our findings provide a comprehensive view on the effect of CF measures and may support effective European climate change mitigation policy.']",public,['372:123253'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5385-5040', 'prefLabel': 'Strauss, Veronika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGF1bCwgQ2Fyc3Rlbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Paul, Carsten'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMO2bm1leiwgQ2Vuaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Dönmez, Cenk'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8636-9009', 'prefLabel': 'Burkhard, Benjamin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Carbon farming for climate change mitigation and ecosystem services – Potentials and influencing factors'],2025-03-06T10:29:43.551+0100,333.0

frl:6511518,"['Agriculture in many developing countries is expected to be severely affected by climate change. The majority of Africa’s population traditionally depends on maize for their livelihoods. The recent invasion and spread of the fall armyworm (FAW), white grubs and other maize pests in Africa is therefore one of the major factors hindering sustainable food security on the continent. Estimating the simultaneous impact of climate change and major pests on maize yields, its spatio-temporal pattern and narrow time windows is most useful for early warning, but is not addressed in the current literature. We present an approach based on remotely sensed climate and biophysical data and agro-system modelling to fill this gap, using Nigeria as an example. We start from a baseline maize yield simulation that produces mean yields of 800–1200\u202fkg\u202fha–1, 1000–1700\u202fkg\u202fha–1 and 1200–2300\u202fkg\u202fha–1 under low, medium and high nitrogen supply, respectively. Potential pest impacts can be responsible for mean yield losses of up to 18–75\u202f% and 8–73\u202f% (USD 72.4 – 675.3\u202fha–1) for white grub and FAW, respectively, under different severity thresholds, depending on locations and when maize was sown. Our findings further collaborates that yield losses due to pests outweigh the direct effects of climate change. Importantly, our findings reveal the influence of changing sowing windows on the magnitude of yield losses. Early sowing resulted in higher yield losses, while medium and late sowing generated lower yield losses for all simulated years. Our pest risk predictions show moderate to high growth index numbers for FAW to occur in Nigeria, especially in the 2021–2060 windows, and most favourable in the cropping seasons in all agro-ecological zones (AEZs). Favourable breeding conditions for FAW decreased over time and were almost absent in the savannahs by 2100.

This study enhances the SIMPLACE modeling framework by incorporating crop-vegetation-livestock models, which contribute to the development of sustainable agricultural practices in response to climate change. Applying such a framework in a domain in West Africa (786,500 km2) allowed us to estimate the changes in crop (Maize, Millet, and Sorghum) yield, grass biomass, livestock numbers, and greenhouse gas emission in response to future climate scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework accurately estimated the key components of the domain for the past (1981–2005) and enables us to project their future changes using dynamically downscaled Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections (2020–2050). The results demonstrate that in the future, the northern part of the study area will likely experience a significant decline in crop biomass (up to -56%) and grass biomass (up to -57%) production leading to a decrease in livestock numbers (up to -43%). Consequently, this will impact total emissions (up to -47% CH4) and decrease of -41% in milk production, and −\u200947% in meat production concentrated in the Sahelian zone. Whereas, in pockets of the Sudanian zone, an increase in livestock population and CH4 emission of about\u2009+\u200924% has been estimated, indicating that variability in climate change impact is amplifying with no consistent pattern evident across the study domain.']",public,['15(1):1399'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3JpdmFzdGF2YSwgQW1pdCBLdW1hcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Srivastava, Amit Kumar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFoaW1pLCBKYWJlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Rahimi, Jaber'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxzYWZhZGksIEthcmFt', 'prefLabel': 'Alsafadi, Karam'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vmlhbm5hLCBNdXJpbG8=', 'prefLabel': 'Vianna, Murilo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RW5kZXJzLCBBbmRyZWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Enders, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhlbmcsIFdlbnpoaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zheng, Wenzhi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVtaXJjYW4sIEFscGFyc2xhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Demircan, Alparslan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGllbmcsIE1hbWUgRGlhcnJhIEJvdXNzbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Dieng, Mame Diarra Bousso'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FsYWNrLCBTZXluaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Salack, Seyni'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmF5ZSwgQmFiYWNhcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Faye, Babacar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2luZ2gsIE1hbm1lZXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Singh, Manmeet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFsZGVyLCBLcmlzaG5hZ29wYWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Halder, Krishnagopal'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXdlcnQsIEZyYW5r', 'prefLabel': 'Ewert, Frank'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2Fpc2VyLCBUaG9tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Gaiser, Thomas'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Modelling mixed crop-livestock systems and climate impact assessment in sub-Saharan Africa'],2025-05-28T11:06:26.715+0200,333.0

Addressing this gap, this study undertakes a comparative institutional analysis of community-level responses to climate threats in violence-prone settings. The research explores conditions that incentivize either cooperation or conflict, refraining from presuming one outcome as dominant. Using a structured analytical framework applied through a thematic analysis, it systematically examines environmental, relational, institutional, and systemic patterns across three case studies of localized collective adaptation to climate change under varying forms of violence. These case studies are located in Guatemala, Philippines and Kenya. The study identifies 18 factors that drive conflict or foster collaboration, revealing that while these factors are broadly consistent across contexts, their effects are highly context-dependent. In some cases, the same factor contributes to both conflict and collaboration within shared adaptation arenas, underscoring the complex interplay of drivers. These findings highlight the importance of analysing interactions among drivers when designing collective climate adaptation efforts, emphasizing opportunities to mitigate violence and foster collaboration. The study concludes that enhancing adaptive capacities and climate-resilient peace requires expanding adaptation strategies to address often-overlooked dynamics. These include the historical processes underpinning institutional multiplicity, the legitimacy of local security forces, and the cohesion among neighbouring communities. By realigning incentives toward collaboration, such interventions can simultaneously build resilience and advance peaceful relations, providing actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners working in violence-prone regions.']",public,['9:100276'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVkaW5hLCBMZW9uYXJkbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Medina, Leonardo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFjaWxsbywgR3Jhemlh', 'prefLabel': 'Pacillo, Grazia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMOkZGVyYWNoLCBQZXRlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Läderach, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYmVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9uYXR0aSwgTWljaGVsbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bonatti, Michelle'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Adapting to climate change under threats of violence: A comparative institutional analysis of incentives for conflict and collaboration'],2025-06-03T08:50:38.743+0200,333.0

The observed disruption of annual patterns in the wavelet spectra of both sites was possibly caused by extreme events. Extreme precipitation events were visible in SWS and P wavelet spectra. Time shifts in correlations between ETa and SWS became smaller at the wetter and warmer site over time in comparison to at the cooler and drier site, where they stayed constant.

Currently, many species are changing their migration strategies, stressing the need to identify and better understand the behavioral correlates of migration. As a partial migrant, the noctule bat, Nyctalus noctula, allows for rare intra-specific investigations of the potential behavioral causes (or consequences) of variation in migration. Here, we combined in-situ behavioral assays with stable isotope analyses to investigate whether spatial and acoustic responses to a roost-like novel environment correlate with migration strategy (local or distant). Given a migrant’s more frequent exposure to novel environments, we predicted migrants would enter a novel environment more quickly and show stronger spatial and acoustic exploration activity. However, individuals of local and distant origin did not differ in acoustic exploration (call activity per unit space), nor, contrasting to several bird studies, in spatial activity (number of chambers visited). Surprisingly, local individuals were more likely than migrants to enter the novel environment. Our findings suggest that small-scale exploration does not vary with migration, potentially because of similar selection pressures across migration strategies on small-scale exploration (e.g., exploration of roosts) as opposed to large-scale. Yet, our findings on the likelihood of entering a novel environment suggest that locals may be more risk-taking. Repeated measures would be necessary to determine if personality differences are underlying these responses. Our unique approach, combining behavioral assays with isotopic geolocation, gave us novel insight into an elusive taxon, highlighting the importance of studying behavioral correlates of migration across various taxa.']",public,['78(6):68'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3913-3519', 'prefLabel': 'Schabacker, Theresa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3722-3094', 'prefLabel': 'Rizzi, Sofia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVpZ2UsIFRvYmlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Teige, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mZm1laXN0ZXIsIFV3ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffmeister, Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1706-4305', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0911-3418', 'prefLabel': 'Snijders, Lysanne'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Behavioral correlates of migration in bats – do migration strategies predict responses to a novel environment?'],2025-06-12T07:45:20.327+0200,336.0

This is not only inefficient, but also leads to ad hoc and often inconsistent implementations of the same theories in computational code and delays progress in the exploration of the functioning of complex social-ecological systems (SES). We argue that reusable building blocks (RBBs) known from professional software development can mitigate these issues. An RBB is a submodel that represents a particular mechanism or process that is relevant across many ABMs in an application domain, such as plant competition in vegetation models, or reinforcement learning in a behavioural model. RBBs need to be distinguished from modules, which represent entire subsystems and include more than one mechanism and process. While linking modules faces the same challenges as integrating different models in general, RBBs are “atomic” enough to be more easily re-used in different contexts. We describe and provide examples from different domains for how and why building blocks are used in software development, and the benefits of doing so for the ABM community and to individual modellers. We propose a template to guide the development and publication of RBBs and provide example RBBs that use this template. Most importantly, we propose and initiate a strategy for community-based development, sharing and use of RBBs. Individual modellers can have a much greater impact in their field with an RBB than with a single paper, while the community will benefit from increased coherence, facilitating the development of theory for both the behaviour of agents and the systems they form. We invite peers to upload and share their RBBs via our website - preferably referenced by a DOI (digital object identifier obtained e.g. via Zenodo).

However, most studies describing their hunting behavior are focused on predation of large prey. Here we describe the capture rates and behavior of adult and subadult spotted hyenas hunting passerine birds. Hyenas were actively chasing, catching and feeding on red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea), a passerine bird gathering in large flocks at a waterhole in the Etosha National Park, Namibia. In total, we observed 38 successful captures with the average individual capture rate of 21 birds caught per hour. It remains unclear if this is a learned behavior of a single hyena clan or if it could be a widespread interaction across Africa, where the two species co-occur. Although it is unlikely that passerines could make up a substantial part of a spotted hyenas diet regardless of the location, our observations provide a rare documented example of trophic interactions between a large carnivore and small birds. It also represents an addition to a diverse repertoire of hyena foraging behaviors, which confirms their adaptability in obtaining food from non-typical sources.']",public,['38:e00340'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG9ydGFzLCBSdWJlbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Portas, Ruben'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JvZmVsLCBNaWhh', 'prefLabel': 'Krofel, Miha'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) predation on passerine birds in Namibia'],2025-06-12T07:41:50.053+0200,336.0
frl:6511791,"[""Pathogens often occur at different prevalence along environmental gradients. This is of particular importance for gradients of anthropogenic impact such as rural-urban transitions presenting a changing interface between humans and wildlife. The assembly of parasite communities is affected by both the external environmental conditions and individual host characteristics. Hosts with low body weight (smaller individuals or animals with poor body condition) might be more susceptible to infection. Furthermore, parasites' mode of transmission might affect their occurrence: rural environments with better availability of intermediate hosts might favour trophic transmission, while urban environments, typically with dense definitive host populations, might favour direct transmission. We here study helminth communities (141 intestinal samples) within the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a synanthropic host, using DNA metabarcoding of multiple marker genes. We analysed the effect of urbanisation, seasonality and host-intrinsic (weight, sex) variables on helminth communities. Helminth species richness increased in foxes with lower body weight and in winter and spring. Season and urbanisation, however, had strong effects on the community composition, i.e., on the identity of the detected species. Surprisingly, transmission in two-host life cycles (trophic transmission) was more pronounced in urban Berlin than in rural Brandenburg. This disagrees with the prevailing hypothesis that trophically transmitted helminths are less prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas. Generally, co-infestations with multiple helminths and high infection intensity are associated with lighter (younger, smaller or low body condition) animals. Both host-intrinsic traits and environmental drivers together shape parasite community composition and turnover along urban-rural gradients.""]",public,['936:173355'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Nob2x6LCBDYXJvbGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Scholz, Carolin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFycXXDrW4tRMOtYXosIFbDrWN0b3IgSHVnbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Jarquín-Díaz, Víctor Hugo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGxhbmlsbG8sIEFpbWFyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Planillo, Aimara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFkY2h1aywgVmlrdG9yaWlh', 'prefLabel': 'Radchuk, Viktoriia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoZXJlciwgQ8OpZHJpYw==', 'prefLabel': 'Scherer, Cédric'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6ZSwgQ2hyaXN0b3Bo', 'prefLabel': 'Schulze, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T3J0bWFubiwgU3lsdmlh', 'prefLabel': 'Ortmann, Sylvia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVyLVNjaGFkdCwgU3RlcGhhbmll', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVpdGxpbmdlciwgRW1hbnVlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Heitlinger, Emanuel'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Host weight, seasonality and anthropogenic factors contribute to parasite community differences between urban and rural foxes']",2025-06-12T07:45:52.203+0200,336.0

Using the GePaRD database (claims data from ~\u200920% of the German population), we determined the annual age-specific and age-standardized prevalence of the use of thyroid diagnostics (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, thyroid ultrasound, scintiscan, biopsy) and treatment (medication, surgery, radioiodine therapy) from 2008 to 2019 stratified by sex.

The films’ morphology, crystallinity, opacity, thermal profile, and functional groups were then studied by scanning electron microscopy, powder diffraction, UV–Vis, thermal gravimetry, and infrared spectroscopy. From the results obtained, the SWF films exhibited a higher MC, DS, and TSM than CRG and CRG-ST films but lower DC values.

frl:6511981,"['BACKGROUND: Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is a curriculum-based approach to learning and teaching about sexuality that focuses on the cognitive, emotional, physical, and social domains. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) CSE guideline emphasizes gender issues and is firmly rooted in a human rights–based approach to sexuality. A recent cross-sectional community readiness assessment in Islamabad, Pakistan, found that the community is at the denial or resistant stage when it comes to implementing school-based sexuality education. The reluctance was attributed to a lack of understanding and widespread misconceptions about CSE. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use the cocreation process to develop, pilot, and evaluate an intervention based on community readiness level to respond to community resistance by introducing CSE content, its anticipated benefits, and addressing prevalent misconceptions through awareness and promotion content for digital social media platforms. METHODS: For the development of the intervention (audio-video content), focus group discussion sessions with key stakeholders were held. Two videos were created in partnership with social media influencers and subsequently shared on Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. A comprehensive process and performance evaluation of the videos and intervention development phase was conducted to evaluate audience exposure, reach, engagement, demographics, retention, and in-depth insights. The videos were uploaded to social media platforms in June and July 2021, and the data used to assess their performance was obtained in February 2022. RESULTS: With a total reach (number of people who have contact with the videos) of 432,457 and 735,563 for the first and second videos, respectively, on all social media platforms, we concluded that social media platforms provide an opportunity to communicate, promote, and engage with important stakeholders to raise awareness and obtain support for CSE. According to the findings, the public is responsive to CSE promotion content developed for social media platforms, with a total engagement (the number of people who participate in creating, sharing, and using the content) of 11,578. The findings revealed that male viewers predominated across all social media platforms. Punjab province had the largest audience share on Instagram (51.9% for the first video, 52.7% for the second) and Facebook (44.3% for the first video and 48.4% for the second). YouTube had the highest audience retention, with viewers watching an average of 151 seconds (45%) of the first video and 163 seconds (38%) of the second. With a net sentiment score of 0.83 (minimum=−3, maximum=5), end-user participation was also positive, and audience feedback highlighted the reasons for positive and negative criticism.

To address this, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data with bulk sequencing data to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) signatures in HCC. Utilizing bioinformatics approaches, including differential gene expression analysis, Cox regression, and logistic regression modeling, we constructed a robust prognostic model that effectively stratifies HCC patients into distinct risk groups with significant differences in survival outcomes. Applying our model to multiple HCC cohorts, robust predictive and prognostic performances were observed. Moreover, examination of the tumor microenvironment (TME) revealed distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration between high-risk and low-risk patient groups, which may contribute to the poorer outcomes observed in high-risk patients. Finally, drug sensitivity and AutoDock simulations suggest that the signature genes we identified could be potential targets for HCC therapy. In summary, this study provides novel insights into the HCC tumor microenvironment and its interaction with TAMs, offering a prognostic model with potential for improving patient stratification and guiding the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Future research ought to concentrate on confirming our findings in larger, prospective studies and examining the functional implications of TAMs in HCC progression.']",public,['20(7):e0325120'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhbmcsIENoYW5ncXVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Shang, Changquan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-6353-0001', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Yi'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Tumor-associated macrophage-based predictive and prognostic model for hepatocellular carcinoma'],2025-07-14T14:15:20.609+0200,355.0

Old age has different faces, which is due to genetic conditions, as well as the different contexts and lifestyles of people.

A total of 115 people were surveyed, including 93 women and 21 men who were students in the first year of the Third Age University at the Pontifical University of John Paul II in Krakow. The surveyed seniors represented an autonomous type of religiosity, a high level of realization of the needs of self-determination, namely autonomy and competence, declared an average assessment of the state of their health, and revealed an increased level of eudaimonic well-being. Predictors of the level of well-being of the surveyed seniors turned out to be the variables religious experience, need for autonomy and competence, and health status, as assessed by the seniors.']",public,['16(8):978'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3838-6570', 'prefLabel': 'Gurba, Ewa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6427-7231', 'prefLabel': 'Wąchol, Grzegorz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0144-7886', 'prefLabel': 'Gurba, Krzysztof'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['The Role of Health, Religiosity, and Motivational Needs in Predicting Psychological Well-Being Among University of the Third Age Students']",2025-07-28T11:34:50.647+0200,355.0

Beyond their utility for ageing, morphological and trace element analysis, otoliths are a repository of valuable genomic information. Previous work has shown that DNA can be extracted from the trace quantities of tissue remaining on the surface of otoliths, despite the fact that they are often stored dry at room temperature. However, much of this work has used reduced representation sequencing methods in clean lab conditions, to achieve adequate yields of DNA, libraries and ultimately single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we pioneer the use of small-scale (spike-in) sequencing to screen contemporary otolith samples prepared in regular molecular biology (in contrast to clean) laboratories for contamination and quality levels, submitting for whole-genome resequencing only samples above a defined endogenous DNA threshold. Despite the typically low quality and quantity of DNA extracted from otoliths, we are able to produce whole-genome libraries and ultimately sets of filtered, unlinked and even putatively adaptive SNPs of ample numbers for downstream uses in population, climate and conservation genomics. By comparing with a set of tissue samples from the same species, we are able to highlight the quality and efficacy of otolith samples from DNA extraction and library preparation, to bioinformatic preprocessing and SNP calling. We provide detailed schematics, protocols and scripts of our approach, such that it can be adopted widely by the community, improving the use of otoliths as a source of valuable genomic data.']",public,['24(8):e14013'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8172-7855', 'prefLabel': 'Caccavo, Jilda Alicia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6701', 'prefLabel': 'Souza Arantes, Larissa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2232-3930', 'prefLabel': 'Celemin Amaro, Enrique'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9633-5045', 'prefLabel': 'Mbedi, Susan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9278-4081', 'prefLabel': 'Sparmann, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6758-5427', 'prefLabel': 'Mazzoni, Camila'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Whole‐genome resequencing improves the utility of otoliths as a critical source of <scp>DNA</scp> for fish stock research and monitoring'],2025-06-12T07:19:13.394+0200,336.0

In such novel settings, the timing of activity is crucial to minimize the risk of mortality. To do so, species may reduce total activity time by increasing activity peaks at specific moments or shifting activity times. We analyzed camera trap data from a citizen science project over four project phases, including spring and autumn before and during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown, to understand the effects of human, pet (cat, dog), and predator (marten) presence on the activity patterns of urban red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris; hereafter ‘squirrel’). We examined squirrel activity at seasonal and hourly resolutions in relation to human, garden, urban, and predator factors. We considered human presence as both a direct effect of lockdown and an indirect disturbance measured through urban variables. Results show that direct human presence during lockdown increased squirrel activity intensity in both seasonal and hourly patterns without reducing total activity time. Predator presence affected timing of activity, decreasing total daily activity. Pets, like cats, decreased activity at both resolutions, while martens had a limited effect detected only at the hourly resolution. During lockdown, squirrels may have increased their activity in gardens due to more anthropogenic resources (food or nesting material), but constant threats from pets force them to avoid certain areas despite the benefits. This highlights the delicate balance squirrels must maintain in adapting to human-altered environments while managing predation risks.']",public,['12:1455142'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHJlbnNrZSwgU2luYWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Drenske, Sinah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG91dnJpZXIsIEp1bGll', 'prefLabel': 'Louvrier, Julie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JhYm93LCBNYXJpdXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Grabow, Marius'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuZGdyYWYsIENvbm55', 'prefLabel': 'Landgraf, Conny'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVyLVNjaGFkdCwgU3RlcGhhbmll', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGxhbmlsbG8sIEFpbWFyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Planillo, Aimara'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Human and predator presence shape diel activity of urban red squirrels'],2025-06-12T07:21:19.107+0200,336.0

To address this gap, we propose a novel fast-learning fine-tuned language model fortified with TTM knowledge.

Within this context, the significance of in-depth analyses of repetitive elements, transposable elements (TEs) in particular, is increasingly recognized in understanding genome evolution. Despite the plethora of available bioinformatic tools for identifying and annotating TEs, the phylogenetic distance of the target species from a curated and classified database of repetitive element sequences constrains any automated annotation effort. Moreover, manual curation of raw repeat libraries is deemed essential due to the frequent incompleteness of automatically generated consensus sequences.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nHere, we present an example of a crowd-sourcing effort aimed at curating and annotating TE libraries of two non-model species built around a collaborative, peer-reviewed teaching process. Manual curation and classification are time-consuming processes that offer limited short-term academic rewards and are typically confined to a few research groups where methods are taught through hands-on experience. Crowd-sourcing efforts could therefore offer a significant opportunity to bridge the gap between learning the methods of curation effectively and empowering the scientific community with high-quality, reusable repeat libraries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe collaborative manual curation of TEs from two tardigrade species, for which there were no TE libraries available, resulted in the successful characterization of hundreds of new and diverse TEs in a reasonable time frame. Our crowd-sourcing setting can be used as a teaching reference guide for similar projects: A hidden treasure awaits discovery within non-model organisms.\r\n']",public,['15(1):10'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVvbmEsIFZhbGVudGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Peona, Valentina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFydGVsb3NzaSwgSmFjb3Bv', 'prefLabel': 'Martelossi, Jacopo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxtb2ppbCwgRGFyZWVu', 'prefLabel': 'Almojil, Dareen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9jaGFya2luYSwgSnVsaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Bocharkina, Julia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnLDpG5uc3Ryw7ZtLCBJb2FuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Brännström, Ioana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnJvd24sIE1heA==', 'prefLabel': 'Brown, Max'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FuZywgQWxpY2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Cang, Alice'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FycmFzY28tVmFsZW56dWVsYSwgVG9tw6Bz', 'prefLabel': 'Carrasco-Valenzuela, Tomàs'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVWcmllcywgSm9u', 'prefLabel': 'DeVries, Jon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9lbGxtYW4sIE1lcmVkaXRo', 'prefLabel': 'Doellman, Meredith'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxzbmVyLCBEYW5pZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Elsner, Daniel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXNww61uZG9sYS1IZXJuw6FuZGV6LCBQYW1lbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Espíndola-Hernández, Pamela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9udG95YSwgR3VpbGxlcm1vIEZyaWlz', 'prefLabel': 'Montoya, Guillermo Friis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FzcGFyLCBCZW5jZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Gaspar, Bence'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmFnb3Jza2ksIERhbmlqZWxh', 'prefLabel': 'Zagorski, Danijela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGHFgmFrdWMsIFBhd2XFgg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hałakuc, Paweł'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXZhbm92c2thLCBCZXRp', 'prefLabel': 'Ivanovska, Beti'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGF1bWVyLCBDaHJpc3RvcGhlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Laumer, Christopher'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVobWFubiwgUm9iZXJ0', 'prefLabel': 'Lehmann, Robert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm-FoXRqYW7EjWnEhywgTGp1ZGV2aXQgTHVrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Boštjančić, Ljudevit Luka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFzaG9vZGgsIFJhaGlh', 'prefLabel': 'Mashoodh, Rahia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF6em9sZW5pLCBTb2ZpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mazzoleni, Sofia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW91dG9uLCBBbGljZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mouton, Alice'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tmlsc3NvbiwgTWFyaWEgQW5uYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Nilsson, Maria Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVpLCBZaWZhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pei, Yifan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG90ZW50ZSwgR2lhY29tbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Potente, Giacomo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJvdmF0YXJpcywgUGFuYWdpb3Rpcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Provataris, Panagiotis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFyZG9zLUJsYXMsIEpvc8OpIFJhbcOzbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pardos-Blas, José Ramón'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF1dCwgUmF2aW5kcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Raut, Ravindra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2JhZmZpLCBUb21hc2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Sbaffi, Tomasa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Nod2FyeiwgRmxvcmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Schwarz, Florian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RhcGxleSwgSmVzc2ljYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Stapley, Jessica'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RldmVucywgTGV3aXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Stevens, Lewis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VsdGFuYSwgTnVzcmF0', 'prefLabel': 'Sultana, Nusrat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3ltb25vdmEsIFJhZGth', 'prefLabel': 'Symonova, Radka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFoYW1pLCBNb2hhZGVzZWggUy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Tahami, Mohadeseh S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VXJ6w6wsIEFsaWNl', 'prefLabel': 'Urzì, Alice'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgSGVpZGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Heidi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVzdWYsIEFiZHVsbGFo', 'prefLabel': 'Yusuf, Abdullah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVjb3Jhcm8sIENhcmxv', 'prefLabel': 'Pecoraro, Carlo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VoLCBBbGV4YW5kZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Suh, Alexander'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Teaching transposon classification as a means to crowd source the curation of repeat annotation – a tardigrade perspective'],2025-06-12T07:40:27.662+0200,336.0

Considering the accessibility and increase in use of tracking devices in wildlife studies, it is important to better understand the effects on these on animals.\r\n2.\tOur endeavour revisits a guideline established in 1988, which proposes that bats may encounter body condition or health problems and alter their behaviour when carrying tags weighing more than 5% of their body mass. Through a systematic literature review, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the impacts of tags on bats, including 367 papers from 1976 to 2023 that discussed, mentioned, employed, or quantified tagging of bats.\r\n3.\tWe noted that the proportion of studies exceeding the 5% rule has not changed in recent years. However, the impact of tags was quantified in few studies for behaviour (n\u2009=\u20097) and body condition (n\u2009=\u200910) of bats. We were unable to assess whether tags weighing less or more than 5% of the bat's body mass impacted bats, but our meta-analysis did identify that tags, irrespective of mass, affect the behaviour and body condition of bats.\r\n4.\tAlthough the overall magnitude of measured effects of tags on bats was small, progress has been made to advance our understanding of tag mass on bats. Naturally, there is a bias in reporting of significant results, illustrating the need of reporting results when there is no apparent effect of tags on bats. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous reporting of behaviour and body condition data associated with tagging of animals and illustrate the importance for studies comparing how tracking devices of different dimensions and masses may impact bat species to ensure research meets rigorous ethical standards.\r\n""]",public,['55(2):e12369'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2384-1999', 'prefLabel': 'Meierhofer, Melissa B.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4406-5933', 'prefLabel': 'Tena, Elena'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5864-4958', 'prefLabel': 'Lilley, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0043-8267', 'prefLabel': 'Dechmann, Dina K.

frl:6511739,"[""BACKGROUND:\r\nExternal tags, such as transmitters and loggers, are often used to study bat movements. However, physiological and behavioural effects on bats carrying tags have rarely been investigated, and recommendations on the maximum acceptable tag mass are rather based on rules of thumb than on rigorous scientific assessment.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nWe conducted a comprehensive three-step assessment of the potential physiological and behavioural effects of tagging bats, using common noctules Nyctalus noctula as a model. First, we examined seasonal changes in body mass. Second, we predicted and then measured potential changes in flight metabolic rate in a wind tunnel. Third, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data to assess effects of different tag masses on the weight and behaviour of bats.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nIndividual body mass of common noctules varied seasonally by 7.0\u2009±\u20092.6 g (range: 0.5–11.5 g). Aerodynamic theory predicted a 26% increase in flight metabolic rate for a common noctule equipped with a 3.8 g tag, equating to 14% of body mass. In a wind tunnel experiment, we could not confirm the predicted increase for tagged bats. Our meta-analysis revealed a weak correlation between tag mass and emergence time and flight duration in wild bats. Interestingly, relative tag mass (3–19% of bat body mass) was not related to body mass loss, but bats lost more body mass the longer tags were attached. Notably, relatively heavy bats lost more mass than conspecifics with a more average body mass index.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nBecause heavy tags (>\u20093 g) were generally used for shorter periods of time than lighter tags (~\u20091 g), the long-term effects of heavy tags on bats cannot be assessed at this time. Furthermore, the effects of disturbance and resource distribution in the landscape cannot be separated from those of tagging. We recommend that tags weighing 5–10% of a bat’s mass should only be applied for a few days. For longer studies, tags weighing less than 5% of a bat's body mass should be used. To avoid adverse effects on bats, researchers should target individuals with average, rather than peak, body mass indices.\r\n""]",public,['12(1):38'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8715-9177', 'prefLabel': 'Kelling, Marit'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5956-0481', 'prefLabel': 'Currie, Shannon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHJveGVsbCwgU2FyYSBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Troxell, Sara A.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7704-5683', 'prefLabel': 'Reusch, Christine'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5298-8071', 'prefLabel': 'Roeleke, Manuel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mZm1laXN0ZXIsIFV3ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffmeister, Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVpZ2UsIFRvYmlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Teige, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0706-3974', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Effects of tag mass on the physiology and behaviour of common noctule bats'],2025-06-12T07:28:17.281+0200,336.0

We analysed the camera-trap data with single-species Bayesian occupancy models to understand factors influencing occurrence and to produce a robust baseline for the species. Large-antlered muntjac occurrence had a positive relationship with elevation and a negative relationship with a least-cost-path measure of remoteness. Mean ± SD estimated occupancy was estimated to be 0.1 ± 0.17 across all stations, and 0.30 ± 0.29 and 0.25 ± 0.15 for the 2 grids where the species was detected. Our results provide new information on the distribution of large-antlered muntjac in Cambodia and can be used to target anti-poaching efforts and monitor population trends over time. Virachey National Park appears to be a stronghold for the species, and conservation actions are needed to ensure that its large-antlered muntjac population does not face the same fate as populations in other parts of the species range.']",public,['53:493-498'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2lub3ZhcywgUA==', 'prefLabel': 'Sinovas, P'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxleGlvdSwgSQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Alexiou, I'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9iZXJ0cywgTw==', 'prefLabel': 'Roberts, O'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9sZGVuLCBK', 'prefLabel': 'Holden, J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhbnRoYSwgTg==', 'prefLabel': 'Chantha, N'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGlsa2VyLCBB', 'prefLabel': 'Tilker, A'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Status and conservation implications of a newly discovered large-antlered muntjac population in Cambodia'],2025-06-12T07:47:17.907+0200,336.0

In the current study, genome-wide association analyses were performed to investigate the genetic variability underlying phenotypic variations in semen characteristics. These traits comprise sperm morphology and sperm motility under different temporal and thermal storage conditions, in addition to standard semen quality parameters. Two consecutive samples of the fourth and fifth ejaculates from the same boar were comprehensively analyzed in a genotyped Piétrain boar population. A total of 13 genomic regions on different chromosomes were identified that contain single-nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with these traits. Subsequent analysis of the genomic regions revealed candidate genes described to be involved in spermatogenesis, such as FOXL3, GPER1, PDGFA, PRKAR1B, SNRK, SUN1, and TSPO, and sperm motility, including ARRDC4, CEP78, DNAAF5, and GPER1.

frl:6511823,"['Elephants have elaborate trunk skills and large, but poorly understood brains. Here we study trunk representations in elephant trigeminal nuclei, which form large protrusions on the ventral brainstem. These ventral brainstem protrusions have previously been referred to as inferior olive, but a delineation of the olivo-cerebellar tract reveals these (trigeminal) nuclei are not connected to the cerebellum via climbing fibers. In contrast, the olivo-cerebellar tract connects to a large dorsolateral nucleus with a serrated cellular architecture, the putative elephant inferior olive. Dense vascularization and intense cytochrome-oxidase reactivity distinguish several elongated trigeminal putative trunk modules, which repeat in the anterior-posterior direction. We focus on the most anterior and largest of these units, the putative nucleus principalis trunk module. Module neuron density is low and non-neural cells outnumber neurons by ∼108:1. Dendritic trees are elongated along the axis of axon bundles (myelin stripes) transversing the trunk module. Synchrotron X-ray-phase-contrast tomography suggests myelin-stripe-axons transverse the trunk module. We show a remarkable correspondence of trunk module myelin stripes and trunk folds. Myelin stripes show little relation to trigeminal neurons and stripe-axons appear to often go nowhere; we suggest that myelin stripes might serve to separate trunk-fold domains rather than to connect neurons. Myelin-stripes-to-folds mapping allowed to determine neural magnification factors, which changed from 1000:1 proximally to 5:1 in the trunk finger. Asian elephants have fewer (∼640,000) trunk-module neurons than Africans (∼740,000) and show enlarged representations of trunk parts involved in object wrapping.

The results suggest a combination of environmental factors, cultural practices, and wildlife conservation measures influence the variability and frequency of infectious diseases in the study including climatic conditions, meat consumption, and scarcity of suitable land for pasture, the presence of wildlife corridors, large livestock numbers and lack of hygiene. Diseases frequently reported to occur were Anthrax, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis, Rabies, Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), and Malaria.

frl:6511688,"[""Memory clinic patients are a heterogeneous population representing various aetiologies of pathological ageing. It is not known whether divergent spatiotemporal progression patterns of brain atrophy, as previously described in Alzheimer's disease patients, are prevalent and clinically meaningful in this group of older adults. To uncover distinct atrophy subtypes, we applied the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm to baseline structural MRI data from 813 participants enrolled in the DELCODE cohort (mean ± standard deviation, age = 70.67 ± 6.07 years, 52% females). Participants were cognitively unimpaired (n = 285) or fulfilled diagnostic criteria for subjective cognitive decline (n = 342), mild cognitive impairment (n = 118) or dementia of the Alzheimer's type (n = 68). Atrophy subtypes were compared in baseline demographics, fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels, the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC-5) as well as episodic memory and executive functioning. PACC-5 trajectories over up to 240 weeks were examined. To test whether baseline atrophy subtype and stage predicted clinical trajectories before manifest cognitive impairment, we analysed PACC-5 trajectories and mild cognitive impairment conversion rates of cognitively unimpaired participants and those with subjective cognitive decline. Limbic-predominant and hippocampal-sparing atrophy subtypes were identified. Limbic-predominant atrophy initially affected the medial temporal lobes, followed by further temporal regions and, finally, the remaining cortical regions. At baseline, this subtype was related to older age, more pathological Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels, APOE ε4 carriership and an amnestic cognitive impairment. Hippocampal-sparing atrophy initially occurred outside the temporal lobe, with the medial temporal lobe spared up to advanced atrophy stages. This atrophy pattern also affected individuals with positive Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and was associated with more generalized cognitive impairment. Limbic-predominant atrophy, in all participants and in only unimpaired participants, was linked to more negative longitudinal PACC-5 slopes than observed in participants without or with hippocampal-sparing atrophy and increased the risk of mild cognitive impairment conversion. SuStaIn modelling was repeated in a sample from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort. Highly similar atrophy progression patterns and associated cognitive profiles were identified. Cross-cohort model generalizability, at both the subject and the group level, was excellent, indicating reliable performance in previously unseen data. The proposed model is a promising tool for capturing heterogeneity among older adults at early at-risk states for Alzheimer's disease in applied settings. The implementation of atrophy subtype- and stage-specific end points might increase the statistical power of pharmacological trials targeting early Alzheimer's disease.

However, this has rarely been studied in free living subjects of different age-groups with standardised methods. The present study investigated the association of the ability to rank sweet and fat taste intensities with consumption frequency of sweet and fatty foods in children, adolescents and adults from eight European countries.\r\nMETHODS: In total, 461 children, 421 adolescents and 612 adults from the IDEFICS/I.Family cohort participated in sensory sweet and fat intensity rating tests. Sweet and fatty food consumption frequencies were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. The association between the ability to rank sweet and fat intensity with sweet and fatty food consumption frequencies was estimated using linear mixed regression models adjusting for weight status, country, sex, age and family affiliation. RESULTS: Across all age groups, the largest proportion of participants had medium sweet and fat taste intensity ranking abilities. The next largest proportion had low sweet and fat taste intensity rating abilities, while the smallest proportion had high intensity rating abilities to sweet and fat taste. A negative association of sweet and fat taste intensity ranking ability with sweet and fatty food consumption frequencies was found for children. In adolescents, the association was positive. In adults, there was no association.\r\nCONCLUSION: It seems that the association of taste intensity ratings with food consumption frequencies during adolescence differs from the associations in children and adults. This could be due to hormonal changes during puberty, growth and maturation. Thus, further research focussing on maturation processes in association with taste perception during adolescence may be required.']",public,['64(1):42'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5799-8383', 'prefLabel': 'Jilani, Hannah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7836-3643', 'prefLabel': 'Intemann, Timm'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWliZW4sIEdhYnJpZWxl', 'prefLabel': 'Eiben, Gabriele'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGF1cmlvLCBGYWJpbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Laurio, Fabio'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzc25lciwgTGF1cmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Lissner, Lauren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWljaGVscywgTmF0aGFsaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Michels, Nathalie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9sbsOhciwgRMOpbmVz', 'prefLabel': 'Molnár, Dénes'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZW5vLCBMdWlzIEE=', 'prefLabel': 'Moreno, Luis A'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFsYSwgVmFsZXJpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Pala, Valeria'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9ybmFyaXRpcywgTWljaGFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Tornaritis, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVpZGViYXVtLiBUb29tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Veidebaum.

GLP-1 regulates postprandial blood glucose by increasing insulin secretion, slowing down gastric emptying and inducing satiety. A selection of specifically developed collagen hydrolysates was screened for their ability to enhance natural GLP-1 production in vitro. The best performing hydrolysate, H80 (Nextida GC), was orally administered at different doses to lean, normoglycemic mice and overweight, prediabetic mice. Lean mice were acutely challenged 45\u2009min before an oral glucose load. While daily supplemented for 6\u2009weeks, prediabetic mice were acutely challenged at day 21 and 34. Oral glucose tolerance, plasma insulin and GLP-1 levels were assessed, and a gastric emptying assay performed in prediabetic mice. H80 significantly lowered the blood glucose response in lean and prediabetic mice, at a 4\u2009g/kg dose (−25% and −36%, respectively), compared to vehicle. In chronically supplemented, prediabetic mice, acute H80 administration slowed down gastric emptying (−60%) after 21\u2009days and increased plasma insulin (+166%) after 35\u2009days of supplementation. H80 increased plasma active GLP-1 in lean (+217%) and prediabetic (+860%) mice. Overall, the data indicate that the specific collagen hydrolysate, H80, has significant GLP-1-mediated effects on oral glucose tolerance in lean and prediabetic mice.

H80 reduced the postprandial glucose response at a 5\u2009g dose in healthy, normoglycemic and prediabetic participants.

As a crucial source of protein absorption in people's daily life, the quality of milk powder products not only has a deep impact on the development of the dairy industry, but also seriously damages the health of consumers. It is of great significance to find a faster and more accurate method for detecting milk protein content. This paper utilizes the chemical content of milk powder and hyperspectral data as independent variables. By comparing 14 kinds of preprocessing algorithms, the mean-centered (MC) method is selected to preprocess the data, and then the combined method of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE) is used to screen the feature wavelength, so as to establish the model and learn the internal dynamic change law of the feature. Furthermore, the Attention mechanism was introduced to assign different weights to bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) hidden states through mapping weighting and learning parameter matrix. To reduce the loss of information and strengthen the influence of important information, at the same time, in order to solve the difficult problem of hyperparameter selection of the model, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed to optimize the hyperparameter selection of the model. The test results showed that with WOA-BiLSTM-Attention model algorithm, the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9975 and root mean square error (RMSEP) of 0.0337 in comparison with R2 and RMSEP values obtained from BiLSTM-Attention model algorithm, which were higher by 0.799% lower by 56.5%, respectively. This study provides algorithm support and theoretical basis for fast non-destructive testing based on deep learning algorithm to predict protein content in milk powder.""]",public,['13(1):e4556'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-1569-364X', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Wenjing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHVlLCBIZXJ1', 'prefLabel': 'Xue, Heru'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhbmcsIFhpbmh1YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jiang, Xinhua'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKaWFuZ3Bpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jiangping'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['An Optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Model Based on Hyperspectral Analysis of Protein Content in Milk Powder'],2025-07-01T10:59:26.668+0200,286.0
frl:6510743,"['OBJECTIVE: This study focused on investigating the relation of age at first birth (AFB) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in women based on the 2011–2020 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data. METHODS: Women were analyzed using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011 to 2020 in the US. Both AFB and RA diagnoses were obtained through self-reported questionnaires. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 7,449 women included in this study, 552 (7%) were diagnosed with RA. In comparison with women who had an AFB of 30–32 years (reference group), those who had an AFB < 18, 18–20, 21–23, 24–26, and > 35 years had the fully adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of 4.00 (95% CI 1.70, 9.40), 2.90 (95% CI 1.25, 6.73), 3.00 (95% CI 1.32, 6.80), 3.18 (95% CI 1.36–7.42), and 3.36 (95% CI 1.04–10.7), respectively. Due to the limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, we have not observed significant differences in the risk of RA between women aged 27–29 and 33–35 at the AFB. Further research is warranted to refine these findings. CONCLUSION: Women with an AFB < 26, or > 35 years have a higher risk of developing RA later in life. Policymakers may consider focusing more on women in these AFB age ranges in screening RA and making preventive measures.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0317443'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7823-403X', 'prefLabel': '崔, 崔航'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIENoZW55YW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Chenyang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWUsIFl1bnRpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ye, Yuntian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBUaWFuY2k=', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Tianci'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIFdlaWppZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Weijie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tml1LCBQdXl1', 'prefLabel': 'Niu, Puyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FvLCBLdWlsaWFuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Gao, Kuiliang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKaWFqaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jiajin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-1277', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Aifeng'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Association between age at first birth and risk of rheumatoid arthritis in women: Evidence from NHANES 2011–2020'],2025-03-20T15:00:17.792+0100,337.0

Utilizing 13C6-labeled glucose to trace metabolic pathways, our study investigated the impact of stress by chronic social defeat (CSD) on glucose metabolites in the liver and brain one week post-stress. We observed a reduction in 13C6-enrichment of glucose metabolites in the liver, contrasting with unchanged levels in the brain. Notably, hepatic glycogen levels were reduced while lactate concentrations were elevated, suggesting lactate as an alternative energy source during stress. Long-term effects were also examined, revealing normalized blood glucose levels and restored glycogen stores in the liver three weeks post-CSD, despite sustained increases in food intake. This normalization is hypothesized to result from diminished glucagon levels leading to reduced glycogen phosphorylase activity. Our findings highlight a temporal shift in glucose metabolism, with hyperglycemia and glycogen depletion in the liver early after CSD, followed by a later phase of metabolic stabilization. These results underscore the liver’s critical role in adapting to CSD and provide insights into the metabolic adjustments that maintain glucose homeostasis under prolonged stress conditions.']",public,['14(1):25511 '],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVpamJvb20sIEZhYmnDq25uZSBTLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Meijboom, Fabiënne S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzY2gsIEFubmlrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hasch, Annika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGUgQXp1YSwgSW5pZ28gUnVpeg==', 'prefLabel': 'De Azua, Inigo Ruiz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29sb2duYSwgQ2FtaWxhIFRha2Vubw==', 'prefLabel': 'Cologna, Camila Takeno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG9vcG1hbnMsIFNoYXVuaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Loopmans, Shauni'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THV0eiwgQmVhdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Lutz, Beat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcO8bGxlciwgTWFyaWFubmUgQi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Müller, Marianne B.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2hlc3F1acOocmUsIEJhcnQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Ghesquière, Bart'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFuIGRlciBLb29paiwgTWljaGFlbCBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Van der Kooij, Michael A.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Adaptations in hepatic glucose metabolism after chronic social defeat stress in mice'],2025-01-29T08:18:02.908+0100,336.0

Initially, differentially expressed circadian rhythm genes between MG and control samples were identified through differential expression analysis. Subsequently, to elucidate the functional roles of differentially expressed CRGs, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Finally, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were applied to identify the hub CRGs. The diagnostic utility of hub genes was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, and their protein expression levels in the serum of patients with MG were assessed utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, we examined the extent of immune cell infiltration in MG and explored its relationship with the identified hub genes. We analyzed the immune infiltration profile in MG and their correlation with the identified hub genes. The GO enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in circadian rhythm-related biological processes. Our investigation identified two hub CRGs that exhibit high diagnostic specificity and sensitivity and are significantly upregulated in serum samples from MG patients.

Thus, evaluating the role of other Rht alleles in stress responses is crucial. Far-red supplementation of white light (W+FR) can induce pre-hardening in cereals at 15°C. However, the relevant effect of blue light enrichment (W+B) is poorly described.

Maris Huntsman background over 10\u2009days at 15°C. The main objectives were to investigate the relationship between light quality, gibberellin homeostasis, and freezing tolerance. Key parameters such as frost injury, hormonal pools and the expression of relevant genes were examined. Results provided evidence about the involvement of Rht alleles in the basal freezing tolerance of wheat leaves from the side of gibberellin availability. It was revealed that W+FR and W+B treatments partially rescued the freezing-sensitive phenotype of Rht12 leaves, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism. Analysis of gibberellic acid (GA) metabolism indicated differential responses to light treatments between the Rht12 and wild-type leaves, with implications for freezing tolerance. Moreover, alterations in hormone levels, including jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), were observed, highlighting the complex interplay between light signalling and hormonal regulation in wheat.

Our previous work identified KINETOCHORE NULL2 (alphaKNL2) as a plant CENH3 assembly factor, which contains a centromere-targeting motif, CENPC-k, analogous to the CENPC motif found in CENP-C. We also demonstrated that alphaKNL2 can bind DNA in vitro in a sequence-independent manner, without the involvement of its CENPC-k motif. In this study, we show that the CENPC-k and CENPC motifs alone are insufficient for centromere targeting in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. In silico analysis identified adjacent DNA-binding regions near the CENPC-k and CENPC motifs, suggesting their role in centromeric DNA interaction. We further demonstrated that protein fragments containing these motifs effectively target centromeres. Deletion of these DNA-binding domains reduced the centromeric localization of alphaKNL2-C, while fusing CENPC-k to the non-specific DNA-binding domain of histone-like nucleoid structuring protein from Escherichia coli successfully targeted it to centromeres. Our findings suggest that the centromeric targeting of alphaKNL2 and CENP-C proteins relies on the CENPC-k/CENPC motifs, and that their sequence-independent DNA-binding activity enhances their centromere anchoring. These insights into the mechanisms of alphaKNL2 and CENP-C targeting may facilitate the engineering of kinetochore structures by directing chromatin-modifying proteins to centromeres.']",public,['53(4):gkae1242'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFsYWdhcGF0aSwgU3VyeWEgUHJha2FzaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Yalagapati, Surya Prakash'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7403-7998', 'prefLabel': 'Ahmadli, Ulkar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2luaGEsIEFkaXR5YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Sinha, Aditya'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8397-3999', 'prefLabel': 'Kalidass, Manikandan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFicmF2b2xza2ksIFNpYXJoZWkg', 'prefLabel': 'Dabravolski, Siarhei '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WnVvLCBTaGVuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zuo, Sheng'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8731-7822', 'prefLabel': 'Yadala, Ramakrishna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5891-6503', 'prefLabel': 'Rutten, Twan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2563-3878', 'prefLabel': 'Talbert, Paul'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1381-9053', 'prefLabel': 'Berr, Alexandre'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3386-2590', 'prefLabel': 'Lermontova, Inna'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Centromeric localization of αKNL2 and CENP-C proteins in plants depends on their centromere-targeting domain and DNA-binding regions'],2025-04-11T11:07:44.682+0200,325.0

This study analyzed the effect of drought on seed germination and the morphological parameters of seedlings from ten winter wheat genotypes. The primary focus was to elucidate the effects of two drought intensities on metabolic status in wheat seedlings. The findings suggest that most wheat genotypes exhibited a significant reduction in germination and growth traits under severe drought, while the genotype Srpanjka exhibited less reduction under both drought conditions. Out of 668 metabolic features, 54 were altered under 10% PEG stress and 140 under 20% PEG stress, with 48 commonly shared between these two stress intensities. This study demonstrated that the metabolic response of shoots to 10% PEG stress contrasts with that of 20% PEG stress. Some growth metabolites, such as oxalic acid, sophorose, and turanose, showed the highest positive increase under both stresses, while butanoic acid, tropic acid, glycine, propionic acid, and phosphonoacetic acid decreased. It is suggested that the accumulation of amino acids, such as proline, contributed to the drought tolerance of the plants. Among all organic acids, succinic and aspartic acids particularly increased the plant response to mild and severe drought stress, respectively. Our results suggest that different metabolites in wheat seedlings enhance the potential ability of wheat to cope with drought stress in the early growth stages by activating a rapid and comprehensive tolerance mechanism.

Raw actigraphy data were pre-processed to interpretable acceleration magnitude and general signal-based features were used to derive activity labels from a human activity recognition model. Qualitative assessment of average activity profiles indicated small differences between groups for activity in the first 5 hours of the day, engagement in moderate-to-vigorous activity, and evening sleep patterns. Of 145 metrics capturing different aspects of physical activity, 57 showed an ability to differentiate between participants with rheumatoid arthritis and non-rheumatoid arthritis controls, most notably activities related to moderate-to-vigorous activity, sleep and the ability to perform sustained activity, which remained different when adjusting for baseline imbalances. Objective measures derived from wrist-worn accelerometer data may be used to assess and quantify the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on daily activity and may reflect rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.

This study aimed to determine (1) the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among university students 1.5\u2009years after the first COVID-19 restrictions and (2) which factors were associated with these outcomes. METHODS: The cross-sectional COVID-19 German Student Well-being Study (C19 GSWS) collected data of 6,996 students at five German universities. Associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms with sociodemographic and other factors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 23.9\u2009years (SD\u2009=\u20094.8), 67% were female and 31% male. The prevalence for depressive symptoms was 29 and 32% for anxiety. The lack of a trusted person and financial difficulties were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Being worried that someone in one’s personal network had become severely ill with COVID-19 and concern about (re)infection with COVID-19 were associated with anxiety symptoms. Those with pre-existing health conditions had an up to 1.98-times higher chance for reporting depressive symptoms (OR, 95% CI: 1.01–3.88) and an up to 2.27-times higher chance for anxiety symptoms, respectively (OR, 95% CI: 1.15–4.46).

The secondary objective was to investigate the sources of dietary AGEs (dAGEs) and their association with dietary composition and anthropometric parameters. Dietary data were collected from 1048 participants via 24 h dietary recall in 2013/2014 to estimate dAGEs intake, while urinary fluorescent AGE levels were measured in 544 individuals. Participants were stratified based on dAGEs intake and compared with respect to urinary fluorescent AGE levels, anthropometric measurements, and dietary intake. The results showed no significant correlation between dietary and urinary fluorescent AGE levels, nor between dAGEs and anthropometric parameters. Notably, higher dAGEs were associated with a diet richer in protein (especially from meat sources) and fat and lower in carbohydrates. In addition, the consumption of ultra-processed foods was lower in participants with a higher DAGE intake. This study highlights the lack of a clear association between dietary and urinary fluorescent AGEs in children, but suggests a distinctive dietary pattern associated with increased dAGEs intake.

By using advanced image processing techniques tailored to examine midbrain and brainstem nuclei with high precision, our study additionally aimed to elucidate differential activation patterns in subcortical nuclei in response to reward-associated and contextually unexpected stimuli, including distinct pathways involving in particular dopaminergic modulation. We observed a differential involvement of the ventral striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and caudate nucleus, as well as a functional specialisation within the subregions of the cingulate cortex for the two salience types. Moreover, distinct subregions within the SN in processing salience could be identified. Dorsal areas preferentially processed salience related to stimulus processing (of both reward and contextual unexpectedness), and ventral areas were involved in salience-related memory encoding (for contextual unexpectedness only). These functional specialisations within SN are in line with different projection patterns of dorsal and ventral SN to brain areas supporting attention and memory, respectively. By disentangling stimulus processing and memory encoding related to two salience types, we hope to further consolidate our understanding of neuromodulatory structures' differential as well as interactive roles in modulating behavioural responses to salient events.

They can show improved resistance to some pathogens and their molecular dissection can contribute to revealing components of plant defense pathways. Although forward-genetics strategies to find genes causal to mutant phenotypes are available in crops, these strategies require the production of experimental cross populations, mutagenesis, or gene editing and are time- and resource-consuming or may have to deal with regulated plant materials. In this study, we described a collection of 34 DLM mutants in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and applied a novel method called complementation by sequencing (CBS), which enables the identification of the gene responsible for a mutant phenotype given the availability of two or more chemically mutagenized individuals showing the same phenotype. Complementation by sequencing relies on the feasibility to obtain all induced mutations present in chemical mutants and on the low probability that different individuals share the same mutated genes. By CBS, we identified a cytochrome P450 CYP71P1 gene as responsible for orange blotch DLM mutants, including the historical barley nec3 locus. By comparative phylogenetic analysis we showed that CYP71P1 gene family emerged early in angiosperm evolution but has been recurrently lost in some lineages including Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Complementation by sequencing is a straightforward cost-effective approach to clone genes controlling phenotypes in a chemically mutagenized collection.

However, its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of TNBC within the US health care context remains to be determined. METHODS: A 5-year Markov model was developed using data from the TORCHLIGHT study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel as a first-line therapy for metastatic or recurrent TNBC in the US. The model incorporated efficacy and safety data, literature-derived costs and utilities, and calculated ICERs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of variable uncertainties on the outcomes. RESULTS: Toripalimab combined with nab-P chemotherapy for TNBC patients resulted in an additional 2.68 life years (LYs) and 1.72 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with an ICER of $593,750 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost and survival utility of toripalimab significantly influence patient outcomes. At a $100,000/QALY WTP threshold, combination therapy was not cost-effective compared with nab-P alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that, from a US health care system perspective, toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy does not demonstrate a significant cost-effective advantage over nab-P chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with TNBC at a WTP threshold of $100,000/QALY and has a limited impact on US health care policy and clinical practice.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0320727'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-7791-8757', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Ping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWlhbywgRGFu', 'prefLabel': 'Qiao, Dan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGlhbywgTGlwaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Xiao, Liping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVuZywgR3VpeWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Deng, Guiya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgUWluZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Qing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGlhbiwgUmVuZGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Tian, Rendi'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Cost-effectiveness analysis of toripalimab combined with nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for advanced TNBC in the US'],2025-04-02T13:47:55.251+0200,337.0
frl:6511094,"[""Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gut disorder linked to changes in the gut microbiota, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB). However, research on LAB biodiversity in IBS patients is limited. This study aimed to compare LAB microbiota in healthy individuals and those with IBS through biochemical and molecular techniques. Fecal samples from 15 IBS patients and 13 healthy individuals were collected, and LAB were isolated using biochemical methods. Fifty isolates were chosen based on Gram staining and catalase tests and identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze strain diversity, and correlation diagrams and swarm plots were employed to explore variable relationships. The study revealed a significant difference in LAB numbers between IBS and healthy subjects, with average of 5.91 and 6.63, respectively. Most bacteria were Gram-positive cocci or bacilli, with homofermentative characteristics, except for one heterofermentative sample from the healthy group. Both IBS and healthy groups exhibited strains from Lactobacillus and Enterococcus genera, with Enterococcus faecium being predominant in both. Demographic analysis showed higher IBS prevalence among individuals aged 20–40, with IBS-C more common in women and IBS-D in men. The study concluded that individuals with IBS had significantly lower LAB microbiota counts, potentially impacting intestinal defense function. Further exploration of LAB behavioral and immunomodulatory traits may enhance understanding of intestinal microbiota's role in IBS and aid in developing treatment strategies.""]",public,['12(11):9212-9226'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXppbWksIEF5c29vZGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Azimi, Aysooda'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4771-5359', 'prefLabel': 'Yavarmanesh, Masoud'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2hvbGFtaW4sIE1laHJhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Gholamin, Mehran'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Comparing lactic acid bacteria biodiversity in irritable bowel syndrome and healthy gut microbiota'],2025-04-16T12:36:45.686+0200,286.0
frl:6511246,"[""BACKGROUND: In humans, environmental enrichment (EE), as measured by the engagement in a variety of leisure activities, has been associated with larger hippocampal structure and better memory function. The present cross-sectional study assessed whether EE during early life (13-30 years) and midlife (30-65 years) is associated with better preserved memory-related brain activity patterns in older age. METHODS: In total, 372 cognitively unimpaired older adults (aged ≥60 years old) of the DZNE-Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE; DRKS00007966) were investigated. EE was operationalized using items of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ), which measures the self-reported participation in a variety of leisure activities in early life and midlife. The preservation of memory-related functional brain activity was assessed using single-value scores, which relate older adults' brain activity patterns in the temporo-parieto-occipital memory network to those of young adults during visual memory encoding (FADE and SAME scores). RESULTS: EE during early life and midlife was significantly associated with higher SAME scores during novelty processing (n = 372, β = 0.13, p = 0.011). Thus, older participants with higher EE showed greater similarity of functional brain activity patterns during novelty processing with young adults. This positive association was observed most strongly in participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 199, β = 0.20, p = 0.006).\r\nCONCLUSION: More frequent participation in a variety of leisure activities in early life and midlife is associated with more successful aging of functional brain activity patterns in the memory network of older adults, including participants at increased risk for dementia. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether higher EE during life could help preserve memory network function in later life.""]",public,['16:1451850'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzcywgU2ltb24=', 'prefLabel': 'Hass, Simon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGllYnNjaGVyLCBNYXhpZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Liebscher, Maxie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9681-6298', 'prefLabel': 'Richter, Anni'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmxpZXNzYmFjaCwgS2xhdXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Fliessbach, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFza2UsQ2hyaXN0b3Bo', 'prefLabel': 'Laske,Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29kZW5rYW1wLCBTZWJhc3RpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sodenkamp, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0ZXJzLCBPbGl2ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Peters, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbG1hbm4tUmVnZW4sIEp1bGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hellmann-Regen, Julian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXJzw7Z6bMO8LCBFcnNpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ersözlü, Ersin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJpbGxlciwgSm9zZWY=', 'prefLabel': 'Priller, Josef'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BydXRoLCBFaWtlIEpha29i', 'prefLabel': 'Spruth, Eike Jakob'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx0ZW5zdGVpbiwgU2xhd2Vr', 'prefLabel': 'Altenstein, Slawek'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UsO2c2tlLCBTYW5kcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Röske, Sandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobmVpZGVyLCBBbmph', 'prefLabel': 'Schneider, Anja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Now7x0emUsIEhhcnRtdXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Schütze, Hartmut'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BvdHRrZSwgQW5uaWth', 'prefLabel': 'Spottke, Annika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXNzZXIsIEFubmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Esser, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVpcGVsLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Teipel, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lsaW1hbm4sIEluZ28=', 'prefLabel': 'Kilimann, Ingo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lsdGZhbmcsIEplbnM=', 'prefLabel': 'Wiltfang, Jens'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9zdGFtemFkZWgsIEF5ZGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Rostamzadeh, Ayda'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhbnosIFdlbnplbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Glanz, Wenzel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SW5jZXNveSwgRW5pc2UgSS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Incesoy, Enise I.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO8c2VicmluaywgRmFsaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Lüsebrink, Falk'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVjaGVudCwgUGV0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Dechent, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGV0emVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Hetzer, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoZWZmbGVyLCBLbGF1cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Scheffler, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FnbmVyLCBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmVzc2VuLCBGcmFuaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Jessen, Frank'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMO8emVsLCBFbXJhaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Düzel, Emrah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2zDtmNrbmVyLCBGcmFua2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Glöckner, Franka'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8237-4481', 'prefLabel': 'Schott, Björn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lydGgsIE1pcmFua2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Wirth, Miranka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xpbWVja2ksIE9sZ2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Klimecki, Olga'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Environmental enrichment is associated with favorable memory-related functional brain activity patterns in older adults'],2025-05-09T11:38:55.383+0200,242.0

The peduncle's developmental properties under dry (drought and heat) conditions make it an ideal attribute for studying its function in tolerance and adaption processes. Thus, we intend to investigate the natural phenotypic and genetic variation of the peduncle length, as well as the genetic reasons underpinning its growth in dry (drought and heat) environments. Under natural drought and heat, the examined characteristic showed a large range of natural variation, showing its involvement in adaptation to such circumstances. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out to evaluate the relationship between 127,022 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and peduncle length at maturity in 184 barley accessions from throughout the world. The genomic research suggest the possibility of 86 marker-trait associations (p-value: > FDR) in various genomic areas, five of which are physically situated on chromosome 3H. The presence of 23 candidate genes was discovered after predicting candidate genes underlying significant relationships. The RNA-sequencing expression profile of candidate genes revealed that the gene HORVU.MOREX.r2.3HG0216310.1, which was identified as a Polynucleotidyl transferase ribonuclease H-like superfamily protein, had the greatest level of expression, indicating its participation in peduncle development under these conditions.

Particularly, the germination and seedling development are sensitive to numerous environmental stresses, especially soil salinity. In this study, we aimed to identify SNP markers linked with germination and seedling development at 150 mM NaCl as a salinity treatment. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of 208 intermedium-spike barley (H. vulgare convar. intermedium (Körn.) Mansf.) accessions and their genotype data (i.e., 10,323 SNPs) using the genome reference sequence of “Morex”. The phenotypic results showed that the 150 mM NaCl salinity treatment significantly reduced all recorded germination and seedling-related traits compared to the control treatment. Furthermore, six accessions (HOR 11747, HOR 11718, HOR 11640, HOR 11256, HOR 11275 and HOR 11291) were identified as the most salinity tolerant from the intermedium-spike barley collection. GWAS analysis indicated that a total of 38 highly significantly associated SNP markers under control and/or salinity traits were identified. Of these, two SNP markers on chromosome (chr) 1H, two on chr 3H, and one on chr 4H were significantly linked to seedling fresh and dry weight under salinity stress treatment. In addition, two SNP markers on chr 7H were also significantly associated with seedling fresh and dry weight but under control condition. Under salinity stress, one SNP marker on chr 1H, 5H and 7H were detected for more than one phenotypic trait. We found that in most of the accessions exhibiting the highest salinity tolerance, most of the salinity-related QTLs were presented. These results form the basis for detailed studies, leading to improved salt tolerance breeding programs in barley.

frl:6511880,"['The genus Weissella, commonly found in fermented foods, is a significant group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with potential probiotic properties. Several Weissella strains have been proposed as probiotics due to their biotechnological capabilities. However, a few strains may exhibit opportunistic pathogenic behavior, which restricts the widespread use of all Weissella strains in food applications. This study sought to expand our understanding of the biotechnological capabilities of Weissella spp. by examining the safety and functional characteristics of strains isolated from spontaneous fermentation. In this investigation, nine Weissella strains were evaluated for their safety and probiotic potential. The safety assessment revealed that the antibiotic resistance profiles of strains 16-2, 38-3, 69-3, 91-3, 91-5, 104-4, and 106-5 were comparable or superior to the reference strain LGG. Hemolytic activity and ammonia production were also evaluated, but no positive results were observed. Further probiotic experiments demonstrated that strain 91-5 exhibited superior performance in several areas, including survival rates in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, cell surface properties (hydrophobicity and adhesion to Caco-2 cells), ABTS+ scavenging ability, antimicrobial activity, and cholesterol assimilation in vitro. Additionally, strain 104-4 produced an exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield of 35.11\u2009g/L after 48\u2009h of culture in MRS-sucrose (60\u2009g/L) medium, surpassing most previously reported values. These findings suggest that strains 91-5 and 104-4 show promise as potential probiotic candidates for the development of new functional food supplements. Furthermore, this research expands the theoretical basis for considering Weissella strains as novel probiotics.']",public,['13(1):e4592'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBDaGVu', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Chen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW4sIENoYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'An, Chao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEppbmdqaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Jingjing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBZYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Yao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFFpd2Vu', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Qiwen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGluZywgSGFv', 'prefLabel': 'Ding, Hao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIFNhaWppYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Saijian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8867-1575', 'prefLabel': 'xue, wenjiao'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","[""Evaluation of Safety and Probiotic Properties of Weissella spp. in Fermented Vegetables From Xi'an, Shaanxi, China""]",2025-06-24T11:51:12.792+0200,286.0

The objective is to identify novel therapeutic targets and offers insights for the clinical management of DDP resistance. Various techniques were employed, including western blot, MTT assay, colony formation assay, scratch assay, transwell assay, tubule formation assay, flow cytometry, Hoechst 33342 fluorescence staining, and in vivo experiments, to investigate the potential mechanisms and effects of the combined application of the STING agonist and ginsenoside RG3 in reversing cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer. The combination markedly suppressed key malignant behaviors, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of SGC-7901/DDP cells. Additionally, this treatment inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and stem cell-like characteristics of SGC-7901/DDP cells, while downregulating the expression of resistance-related proteins. The STING agonist effectively suppresses the growth and proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Ginsenoside RG3, well-documented for its multifaceted properties, including antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-cancer effects, is widely used in cancer treatment and in managing chemotherapy-related side effects. Furthermore, RG3 enhances anti-tumor immunity by regulating signal transduction. This study comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of the STING agonist and RG3 combination through in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating significant inhibition of malignant progression and reversal of drug resistance in gastric cancer.

Total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides leaves (TFEL) display antioxidant activity, yet its prevention of MGO-induced apoptosis and mechanisms are unclear. Our study used western blotting and ELISA to evaluate protein levels and enzyme activities. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK8 assay and PE Annexin V/7-AAD double staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using fluorescence probes. Vascular pathological changes and apoptosis were analyzed through H&E and TUNEL staining. In vitro, MGO-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with varying TFEL concentrations. Our results demonstrated that TFEL significantly enhanced cell viability, reduced apoptosis, downregulated caspase-3 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Moreover, TFEL markedly suppressed MGO-induced ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) production while restoring antioxidant enzyme activity and MMP. TFEL pretreatment promoted the expression of p-Akt, Nrf2, and HO-1 proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of p-Akt significantly suppressed the upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels mediated by TFEL. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of Nrf2 or p-Akt partially abrogated the protective effects of TFEL against MGO-induced damage in HUVECs. In vivo studies revealed that TFEL (100 and 200\u2009mg/kg) partially restored antioxidant capacity and reduced aortic thickness and apoptosis in MGO-injured mice. In conclusion, the findings indicate that TFEL mitigates MGO-induced apoptosis via activation of p-Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 and scavenging of oxidative stress, highlighting its potential in diabetic vascular complication management.']",public,['12(10):7938-7953'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0652-9186', 'prefLabel': 'Deng, Xin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFFpYW5mZW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Qianfeng'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4975-0625', 'prefLabel': 'liu, youping'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves flavonoids attenuate methylglyoxal-induced endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by upregulating AKT-Nrf2 signaling and downregulating oxidative stress'],2025-03-17T11:33:18.005+0100,286.0

This study aims to investigate the content of menaquinone-7 (MK-7), an essential form of vitamin K, and other fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E) during the fermentation of various fermented milk products. The vitamin contents of six fermented milk products were analyzed: two yogurt samples (produced with commercial starter and probiotic starter), two kefir samples (produced with commercial starter and kefir grain), and milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium bifidum. Throughout the fermentation process, continuous pH monitoring was conducted, and fermentation was terminated based on pH levels. Fat-soluble vitamins and vitamins K1, K2 were extracted from samples taken at specific fermentation periods and quantitatively determined using the reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) method. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines. Simultaneously, the microbial content of the samples was analyzed. Among the fermented dairy products analyzed, the highest MK-7 content (4.82\u2009μg/100\u2009g) was found in the kefir sample produced with kefir grain (KG). The diverse microorganisms in kefir grains necessitated detailed research to explain their role in this complex mechanism. In yogurt samples, the presence of L.\u2009acidophilus in the YB sample suggests that this bacterium may be responsible for the observed differences. This is supported by the LA sample, where production with L.\u2009acidophilus strain showed an increase from 0.97 to 1.70 at the 20th hour of fermentation. It was noted that the concentration of menaquinone-7 increased throughout the fermentation period. Given the critical health effects of essential fat-soluble vitamins and MKs, determining their content in commonly consumed fermented dairy products and understanding the influence of starter cultures, which are potential probiotics, on vitamin production underscores the importance of this research. It is important to highlight the potential of fermented products in nutritional recommendations.']",public,['12(11):9822-9833'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx0dW5jdSwgVmlsZGFu', 'prefLabel': 'Altuncu, Vildan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0342-6009', 'prefLabel': 'Kaymaz, Aykut'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5633-6641', 'prefLabel': 'Ertekin Filiz, Bilge'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6270-7509', 'prefLabel': 'Çubuk Demiralay, Ebru'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8813-6479', 'prefLabel': 'Kök Taş, Tuğba'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Evaluation of MENAQUINONE-7 and fat-soluble vitamin production by starter cultures during fermentation in dairy products using RPLC method'],2025-05-21T10:52:28.467+0200,286.0

While numerous studies reported worsened conditions in individuals with pre-existing mental disorders, others showed resilience and stability in mental health. However, longitudinal data focusing on the German population are sparse, especially regarding effects of age and pre-existing mental disorders during the early stages of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To assess the interplay between psychiatric history, age, and the timing of the pandemic, with a focus on understanding how these factors relate to the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Exploratory analyses were based on 135,445 individuals aged 20–72\u2009years from the German National Cohort (NAKO). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Inferential statistical analyses and negative binomial regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Persons with a self-reported psychiatric history exhibited comparable levels of depression and anxiety symptom severity after the first wave of the pandemic compared to the time before. In contrast, individuals without a psychiatric history, particularly those in their 20s to 40s, experienced an increase in mental health symptom severity during the first wave of the pandemic. LIMITATIONS: Analyses focuses on the first wave of the pandemic, leaving the long-term mental health effects unexplored. CONCLUSION: Future research should consider age-specific and mental-health-related factors when addressing global health crises. Additionally, it is important to explore factors influencing resilience and adaptation, aiming to develop targeted interventions and informed policies for effective mental health management during pandemics.']",public,['12:451631'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RlaW4sIEphbmluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Janine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFic3QsIEFsZXhhbmRlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pabst, Alexander'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVyZ2VyLCBLbGF1cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Berger, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FyY2gsIEFuZHLDqQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Karch, André'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVpc21hbm4sIEhlbm5pbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Teismann, Henning'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RyZWl0LCBGYWJpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Streit, Fabian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JhYmUsIEhhbnMgSg==', 'prefLabel': 'Grabe, Hans J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWlrb2xhamN6eWssIFJhZmFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Mikolajczyk, Rafael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFzc2FnLCBKYW5rYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Massag, Janka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGllYiwgV29sZmdhbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Lieb, Wolfgang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FzdGVsbCwgU3RlZmFuaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Castell, Stefanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVpc2UsIEphbmEgSw==', 'prefLabel': 'Heise, Jana K'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6ZSwgTWF0dGhpYXMgQg==', 'prefLabel': 'Schulze, Matthias B'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FzdGVsbCwgU3lsdmlh', 'prefLabel': 'Gastell, Sylvia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFydGgsIFZvbGtlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Harth, Volker'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T2JpLCBOYWRpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Obi, Nadia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0ZXJzLCBBbm5ldHRl', 'prefLabel': 'Peters, Annette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVlbWVyLCBNYXJpZS1UaGVyZXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Huemer, Marie-Theres'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9obWFubiwgUGF0cmljaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Bohmann, Patricia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVpdHptYW5uLCBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Leitzmann, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoaXBmLCBTYWJpbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Schipf, Sabine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVpbmtlLUZyYW56ZSwgQ2xhdWRpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Meinke-Franze, Claudia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-5958', 'prefLabel': 'Hebestreit, Antje'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9020-4629', 'prefLabel': 'Fuhr, Daniela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWljaGVscywgS2FyaW4gQi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Michels, Karin B.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFza3Vsc2tpLCBTdGVmYW5pZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jaskulski, Stefanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RvY2tlciwgSGFubmFo', 'prefLabel': 'Stocker, Hannah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29jaC1HYWxsZW5rYW1wLCBMZW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Koch-Gallenkamp, Lena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lsbGljaCwgU3RlZmFuIE4u', 'prefLabel': 'Willich, Stefan N.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2VpbCwgVGhvbWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Keil, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO2ZmZsZXIsIE1hcmt1cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Löffler, Markus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lya25lciwgS2Vyc3Rpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wirkner, Kerstin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmllZGVsLUhlbGxlciwgU3RlZmZpIEcu', 'prefLabel': 'Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Mental health of individuals with pre-existing mental illnesses at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic: results of the German National Cohort (NAKO)'],2025-03-13T10:15:18.863+0100,266.0

METHODS: A list of metadata was created from a review of existing metadata catalogues and recommendations, structured interviews, a stakeholder survey, and a technical workshop. The prototype was designed to comply with the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), using MOLGENIS software. Metadata collection was piloted by 15 data access partners (DAPs) from across Europe. RESULTS: A total of 442 metadata variables were defined in six domains: institutions (organizations connected to a data source); data banks (data collections sustained by an organization); data sources (collections of linkable data banks covering a common underlying population); studies; networks (of institutions); and common data models (CDMs). A total of 26 institutions were recorded in the prototype. Each DAP populated the metadata of one data source and its selected data banks. The number of data banks varied by data source; the most common data banks were hospital administrative records and pharmacy dispensation records (10 data sources each).

frl:6509981,"['BACKGROUND: The rapid progression and integration of digital technologies into public health have reshaped the global landscape of health care delivery and disease prevention. In pursuit of better population health and health care accessibility, many countries have integrated digital interventions into their health care systems, such as web-based consultations, electronic health records, and telemedicine. Despite the increasing prevalence and relevance of digital technologies in public health and their varying definitions, there has been a shortage of studies examining whether these technologies align with the established definition and core characteristics of digital public health (DiPH) interventions. Hence, the imperative need for a scoping review emerges to explore the breadth of literature dedicated to this subject. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to outline DiPH interventions from different implementation stages for health promotion, primary to tertiary prevention, including health care and disease surveillance and monitoring. In addition, we aim to map the reported intervention characteristics, including their technical features and nontechnical elements. METHODS: Original studies or reports of DiPH intervention focused on population health were eligible for this review. PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, IEEE Xplore, and the ACM Full-Text Collection were searched for relevant literature (last updated on October 5, 2022). Intervention characteristics of each identified DiPH intervention, such as target groups, level of prevention or health care, digital health functions, intervention types, and public health functions, were extracted and used to map DiPH interventions. MAXQDA 2022.7 (VERBI GmbH) was used for qualitative data analysis of such interventions’ technical functions and nontechnical characteristics. RESULTS: In total, we identified and screened 15,701 records, of which 1562 (9.94%) full texts were considered relevant and were assessed for eligibility. Finally, we included 185 (11.84%) publications, which reported 179 different DiPH interventions. Our analysis revealed a diverse landscape of interventions, with telemedical services, health apps, and electronic health records as dominant types. These interventions targeted a wide range of populations and settings, demonstrating their adaptability. The analysis highlighted the multifaceted nature of digital interventions, necessitating precise definitions and standardized terminologies for effective collaboration and evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Although this scoping review was able to map characteristics and technical functions among 13 intervention types in DiPH, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence might have been underrepresented in our study. This review underscores the diversity of DiPH interventions among and within intervention groups. Moreover, it highlights the importance of precise terminology for effective planning and evaluation. This review promotes cross-disciplinary collaboration by emphasizing the need for clear definitions, distinct technological functions, and well-defined use cases. It lays the foundation for international benchmarks and comparability within DiPH systems. Further research is needed to map intervention characteristics in this still-evolving field continuously.']",public,['26:e53927'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-8120', 'prefLabel': 'Maaß, Laura'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-9663-6643', 'prefLabel': 'Angoumis, Konstantinos'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9895-9997', 'prefLabel': 'Freye, Merle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2710-3259', 'prefLabel': 'Pan, Chen-Chia'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Mapping Digital Public Health Interventions Among Existing Digital Technologies and Internet-Based Interventions to Maintain and Improve Population Health in Practice: Scoping Review'],2025-02-07T09:40:34.037+0100,266.0

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were performed to identify characteristic genes and construct the diagnostic models. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify the biological processes of psoriasis characteristic gene sets. GO and KEGG pathway analysis were combined to elucidate the potential biological significance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The accuracy of biomarker identification was further validated using immune cell infiltration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on external data (GSE6710\\GSE30999\\GSE14905).\r\nRESULTS:\r\nA total of 5 genes (DEFB103A, OAS3, OASL, SAMD9, STAT1) were co-identified as characteristic genes in psoriasis progression and treatment.

frl:6510755,"['Instrumental variables (IVs) methods have recently gained popularity since, under certain assumptions, they may yield consistent causal effect estimators in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Existing simulation studies that evaluate the performance of IV approaches for time-to-event outcomes tend to consider either an additive or a multiplicative data-generating mechanism (DGM) and have been limited to an exponential constant baseline hazard model. In particular, the relative merits of additive versus multiplicative IV models have not been fully explored. All IV methods produce less biased estimators than naïve estimators that ignore unmeasured confounding, unless the IV is very weak and there is very little unmeasured confounding. However, the mean squared error of IV estimators may be higher than that of the naïve, biased but more stable estimators, especially when the IV is weak, the sample size is small to moderate, and the unmeasured confounding is strong. In addition, the sensitivity of IV methods to departures from their assumed DGMs differ substantially. Additive IV methods yield clearly biased effect estimators under a multiplicative DGM whereas multiplicative approaches appear less sensitive. All can be extremely variable. We would recommend that survival probabilities should always be reported alongside the relevant hazard contrasts as these can be more reliable and circumvent some of the known issues with causal interpretation of hazard contrasts. In summary, both additive IV and Cox IV methods can perform well in some circumstances but an awareness of their limitations is required in analyses of real data where the true underlying DGM is unknown.']",public,['34(1):3-25'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Sm9obiwgRWxlYW5vciBSLg==', 'prefLabel': 'John, Eleanor R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3Jvd3RoZXIsIE1pY2hlYWwgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Crowther, Micheal J.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8587-7706', 'prefLabel': 'Didelez, Vanessa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlZWhhbiwgTnVhbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Sheehan, Nuala'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Multiplicative versus additive modelling of causal effects using instrumental variables for survival outcomes – a comparison'],2025-03-21T10:57:24.109+0100,266.0

Hydrolyzed milk protein is a mainstream way to address this difficulty. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of differences in whey protein concentrate (WPC) source and the degree of hydrolysis on blocking allergy and to analyze the possible mechanisms by which hydrolyzed infant formula (IF) blocks allergy through colony-metabolism–immunity response. First, we prepared six groups of goat's milk IF with unhydrolyzed, partially, and extensively hydrolyzed WPC, which come from cow's milk WPC and goat's milk WPC. Subsequently, we evaluated their effects on allergy. The results showed that the hydrolyzed IF improved the allergic characteristics of mice, including low levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), specific IgE, histamine, and mucosal mast cell protease-1 (mMCP-1). Furthermore, the hydrolyzed IF promoted the immune response of T helper 1 (Th1) and regulatory T (Treg) cells by enhancing the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of T-box transcription factor 21 (T-bet) and forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3), which in turn suppressed the T helper 2 (Th2) overexpressed immune response in allergy (GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) mRNA expression, as well as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 5 (IL-5) levels). Hydrolyzed IF promoted an increase in beneficial gut microbe Lactobacillus and Alistipes, which in turn promoted an increase in intestinal butyrate levels. The beneficial bacteria and their metabolized butyrate may have suppressed the abundance of the allergy-characterizing bacterium Rikenellaceae-RC9-gut-group. The final result we obtained was that for both cow's milk WPC and goat's milk WPC, at similar levels of hydrolysis, they did not bring about a significant effect on allergy symptoms. The hydrolyzed IF improved the allergic characteristics of mice, the deeper the degree of hydrolysis of WPC, the more obvious the effect of reducing allergic symptoms in model mice.""]",public,['12(11):9525-9539'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGllLCBRaW5nZ2FuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Xie, Qinggang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBTaWJv', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Sibo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2086-1716', 'prefLabel': 'dongying, cui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBZYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Yang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWGlhbmd4aW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Xiangxin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FvLCBUaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Cao, Ting'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIFhpYW94aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Xiaoxi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIEJhaWxpYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Bailiang'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Hydrolyzed milk infant formula effectively protects against milk protein allergy: Independent of whey protein source'],2025-05-08T10:36:49.098+0200,286.0

HCMV intermediate-early protein 2 (IE2) has been identified as a crucial factor in immune evasion mechanisms. However, the specific immunomodulatory effects of IE2 on antigen presentation remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we established a transgenic mouse model to systematically examine the impact and molecular mechanisms of IE2 on macrophages (Mφs) antigen presentation in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that IE2 modifies Mφs’ function by preventing their phagocytic activity and polarization. Additionally, IE2 inhibits Mφs overactivation both in vivo and in vitro, which raises IL-10 levels and activates the downstream mediator STAT3, which in turn decreases T cell immune responses by encouraging T helper 2 (Th2) type responses. In conclusion, these findings underscore the potential of IE2 as a critical regulator of immune evasion and may contribute to the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies against the virus.']",public,['20(5):e0322334'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0585-4438', 'prefLabel': 'Xianjuan, Zhang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgUWluZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Qing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuLCBTaHVv', 'prefLabel': 'Han, Shuo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29uZywgR3VhbmdodWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Song, Guanghui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgQmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Bin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWXVueWFuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Yunyang'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Human cytomegalovirus-IE2 suppresses antigen presentation of macrophage through the IL10/STAT3 signalling pathway in transgenic mouse'],2025-05-06T14:17:23.891+0200,337.0

Elucidating the effects of demographic factors, hypertension, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and AD pathology on PVS dynamics could inform the role of PVS in brain health function as well as the complex pathophysiology of AD. METHODS: We studied PVS in centrum semiovale (CSO) and basal ganglia (BG) computationally over three to four annual visits in 503 participants (255 females; meanage = 70.78 ± 5.78) of the ongoing observational multicentre ""DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study"" (DELCODE) cohort. We analysed data from subjects who were cognitively unimpaired (n = 401), had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), or had AD (n = 31). We used linear mixed-effects modelling to test for changes of PVS volumes in relation to cross-sectional and longitudinal age, as well as sex, years of education, hypertension, white matter hyperintensities, AD diagnosis, and cerebrospinal-fluid-derived amyloid (A) and tau (T) status (available for 46.71%; A-T-/A + T-/A + T + n = 143/48/39).\r\nRESULTS: PVS volumes increased significantly over follow-ups (CSO: B = 0.03 [0.02, 0.05], p < 0.001; BG: B = 0.05 [0.03, 0.07], p < 0.001). PVS enlargement rates varied substantially across subjects and depended on the participant\'s age, white matter hyperintensities volumes, and amyloid and tau status. PVS volumes were higher across elderly participants, regardless of region of interest (CSO: B = 0.12 [0.02, 0.21], p = 0.017; BG: B = 0.19 [0.09, 0.28], p < 0.001). Faster BG-PVS enlargement related to lower baseline white matter hyperintensities volumes (ρspearman = -0.17, pFDR = 0.001) and was more pronounced in individuals who presented with combined amyloid and tau positivity versus negativity (A + T + > A-T-, pFDR = 0.004) or who were amyloid positive but tau negative (A + T + > A + T-, pFDR = 0.07). CSO-PVS volumes increased at a faster rate with amyloid positivity as compared to amyloid negativity (A + T-/A + T + > A-T-, pFDR = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Our longitudinal evidence supports the relevance of PVS enlargement in presumably healthy ageing as well as in AD pathology. We further discuss the region-specific involvement of white matter hyperintensities and neurotoxic waste accumulation in PVS enlargement and the possibility of additional factors contributing to PVS progression. A comprehensive understanding of PVS dynamics could facilitate the understanding of pathological cascades and might inform targeted treatment strategies.

It has been proposed that neuroinflammation might be an intervening variable, but the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown.\r\nMETHODS: We utilized primary neurons to induce synaptic insulin resistance as well as a mouse model of high-risk aging that includes a high amyloid load, neuroinflammation, and diet-induced obesity to test hypotheses on underlying mechanisms.\r\nRESULTS: We found that neddylation and subsequent activation of cullin-RING ligase complexes induced synaptic insulin resistance through ubiquitylation and degradation of the insulin-receptor substrate IRS1 that organizes synaptic insulin signaling. Accordingly, inhibition of neddylation preserved synaptic insulin signaling and rescued memory deficits in mice with a high amyloid load, which were fed with a 'western diet'. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the data suggest that neddylation and degradation of the insulin-receptor substrate is a nodal point that links high amyloid load, neuroinflammation, and synaptic insulin resistance to cognitive decline and impaired synaptic plasticity in high-risk aging.""]",public,['11(1):2'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-1256', 'prefLabel': 'Confettura, Alessandro Dario'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3Vib25pLCBFbGVvbm9yYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cuboni, Eleonora'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1tYXIsIE1vaGFtZWQgUmFmZWV0', 'prefLabel': 'Ammar, Mohamed Rafeet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhLCBTaGFvYm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Jia, Shaobo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29tZXMsIEd1aWxoZXJtZSBNLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Gomes, Guilherme M.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3746-3282', 'prefLabel': 'YUANXIANG, PingAn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFtYW4sIFJhamVldg==', 'prefLabel': 'Raman, Rajeev'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFRpbmd0aW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Tingting'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8298-176X', 'prefLabel': 'Grochowska, Katarzyna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWhyZW5kcywgUm9iZXJ0', 'prefLabel': 'Ahrends, Robert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FycG92YSwgQW5uYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Karpova, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0472-0553', 'prefLabel': 'Dityatev, Alexander'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0575-6950', 'prefLabel': 'Kreutz, Michael R.'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","[""Neddylation-dependent protein degradation is a nexus between synaptic insulin resistance, neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease""]",2025-05-14T12:59:37.980+0200,242.0

Transfer of Tregs is a potential means of treating severe food allergy; however, methods to obtain allergen-specific Tregs with stable regulatory activities are needed. To achieve our goal, we examined the characteristics of allergen-specific Tregs by comparing two mouse strains transgenic for the ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cell receptor gene: Rag23−3 and RagD10 mice (OVA23−3 and DO11.10 crossed with Rag2 knockout mice, respectively). RagD10 is a tolerant model, whereas Rag23−3 shows severe allergy when fed egg white (EW). To examine the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs (induced Tregs; iTregs), CD4+ T cells or whole cells from mesenteric lymph nodes or spleens were cultured under Treg-polarization conditions and stimulated with either a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies or OVA plus antigen-presenting cells. After stimulation with the antibodies, iTregs were induced at comparable levels from CD4+ T cells from untreated Rag23−3 and RagD10 mice. Transfer of the resultant iTregs from untreated Rag23−3 mice suppressed allergic responses in EW-fed Rag23−3 mice. In contrast, stimulation with OVA plus antigen-presenting cells prevented the differentiation of iTregs from CD4+ T cells from untreated Rag23−3 mice, suggesting that OVA-induced T-cell receptor signaling inhibits effective Treg differentiation. Furthermore, antibody-mediated differentiation afforded significantly more iTregs differentiation of naïve (CD44loCD62Lhi) CD4+ T cells than of effector/effector memory (CD44hiCD62Llo) T cells isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of EW-fed Rag-23–3 mice. Excessive production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma by CD4+ T cells from EW-fed Rag23−3 mice significantly inhibited Treg induction in RagD10 mice, suggesting the severe allergic cytokine milieu likely prevents their differentiation. However, our study showed that allergen-specific Tregs with regulatory activity can be obtained from naïve CD4+ T cells from the intestinal immune system of mice even with severe allergy.']",public,['20(5):e0324105'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpYmFoYXJhLCBLeW9rbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Shibahara, Kyoko'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9zaGlubywgVG9tb2hpcm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Hoshino, Tomohiro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmFrYW5pc2hpLCBIYXJ1a2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Nakanishi, Haruka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmlzaGl0c3VqaSwgS29zdWtl', 'prefLabel': 'Nishitsuji, Kosuke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29nYSwgS29oZWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Soga, Kohei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFtYmEsIFlvc2hpeW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Bamba, Yoshiyo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFjaGltdXJhLCBTYXRvc2hp', 'prefLabel': 'Hachimura, Satoshi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2008-2501', 'prefLabel': 'Nakajima-Adachi, Haruyo'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells differentiated from the naïve phenotype (CD44loCD62Lhi) in mesenteric lymph nodes stably suppress enteropathy even in severe food-allergic mice'],2025-06-03T14:33:24.569+0200,337.0

This is because HG conditions trigger uncontrolled lipid peroxidation, leading to iron-dependent ferroptosis, which is caused by glucolipotoxicity. However, natural flavonoid compound Orientin (Ori) possesses anti-inflammatory bioactive properties and is a promising treatment for a range of diseases. The current study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of Ori in HG-mediated ferroptosis. A diabetic wound model was established in mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and HUVECs were cultured under HG to create an in vitro diabetic environment. The results demonstrated that Ori inhibited HG-mediated ferroptosis, reducing levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), while increasing decreased levels of malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, as well as increased levels of glutathione (GSH). Ori treatment also improved the wound expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and angiogenesis markers, reversing the delayed wound healing caused by diabetes mellitus (DM). Additional investigations into the mechanism revealed that Ori may stimulate the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/GPX4 signaling pathway. Silencing Nrf2 in HG-cultured HUVECs negated the beneficial impact mediated by Ori.

Importantly, the latter association depended on current affect levels: Participants high relative to low in neuroticism showed stronger subsequent fluctuations in affect balance when currently feeling better than usual, but weaker subsequent fluctuations in (and thus more persistent) affect balance when currently feeling worse than usual.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nIncreased variability should not be seen as a bad sign but may be a sign that an affective system is changing, which may be adaptive or maladaptive for an individual, depending on the initial state of the system.']",public,['Early View'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2839-9482', 'prefLabel': 'Wenzel, Mario'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmluZ3dhbGQsIFdoaXRuZXkgUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ringwald, Whitney R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2F1cmluLCBBbGVrc2FuZHJh', 'prefLabel': 'Kaurin, Aleksandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VMO8c2NoZXIsIE9saXZlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Tüscher, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3ViaWFrLCBUaG9tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Kubiak, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3JpZ2h0LCBBaWRhbiBHLiBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wright, Aidan G.

And these patients were from Shandong Provincial Hospital and had received immunotherapy. We then used the solid tumor response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST v1.1) to determine whether the patient’s condition was evaluated for clinical benefit response (CBR) or non-clinical benefit (NCB). Subsequently, serum zinc levels were assessed using ICP-MS.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nWe have identified for the first time that elevated levels of serum zinc (>14.2μg/L) in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy can serve as a novel biomarker for improved overall survival (20.0m vs 10.0m; p < 0.0001), as determined by continuous serum zinc data using ROC curve analysis (sensitivity: 100.00%, specificity: 41.86%, p\u2009=\u20090.0009) in both CBR (n\u2009=\u200943) and NCB patients (n\u2009=\u200925) within the training group. Bioinformatics analysis has revealed that serum zinc may modulate cellular DNA replication through the MAPK and NF-kB pathways, with proteomic analysis confirming enrichment of these pathways based on KEGG and GO analyses. Consequently, a nomogram incorporating multiple clinical and independent factors has been developed to provide enhanced predictive capability.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: \r\nSerum zinc levels are positively associated with the effectiveness of ICIs in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, potentially through their modulation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways.

Among apomictic plants (reproducing asexually through seeds) many require paternal genetic contribution for proper endosperm development (pseudogamous endosperm). We examined phenotypic diversity in seed traits using a diverse panel of sexual and apomictic accessions from the genus Boechera. While genetic uniformity resulting from asexual reproduction is expected to reduce phenotypic diversity in seeds produced by apomictic individuals, pseudogamous endosperm, variable endosperm ploidy, and the deviations from 2:1 maternal:paternal genome ratio in endosperm can all contribute to increased phenotypic diversity among apomictic offspring. We characterized seed size variation in 64 diploid sexual and apomictic (diploid and triploid) Boechera lineages. In order to find out whether individual seed size was related to endosperm ploidy we performed individual seed measurements (projected area and mass) using the phenoSeeder robot system and flow cytometric seed screen. In order to test whether individual seed size had an effect on resulting fitness we performed a controlled growth experiment and recorded seedling life history traits (germination success, germination timing, and root growth rate). Seeds with triploid embryos were 33% larger than those with diploid embryos, but no average size difference was found between sexual and apomictic groups. We identified a maternal effect whereby chloroplast lineage 2 had 30% larger seeds than lineage 3, despite having broad and mostly overlapping geographic ranges. Apomictic seeds were not more uniform in size than sexual seeds, despite genetic uniformity of the maternal gametophyte in the former. Among specific embryo/endosperm ploidy combinations, seeds with tetraploid (automomous) endosperm were on average smaller, and the proportion of such seeds was highest in apomicts. Larger seeds germinated more quickly than small seeds, and lead to higher rates of root growth in young seedlings. Seed mass is under balancing selection in Boechera, and it is an important predictor of several traits, including germination probability and timing, root growth rates, and developmental abnormalities in apomictic accessions.']",public,['13:991531'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFjemVzbmlhaywgRG9yb3Rh', 'prefLabel': 'Paczesniak, Dorota'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVsbGlubywgTWFyY28=', 'prefLabel': 'Pellino, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29lcnR6ZW4sIFJpY2hhcmQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Goertzen, Richard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VlbnRlciwgRGV2YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Guenter, Devan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFobmtlLCBTaWVnZnJpZWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Jahnke, Siegfried'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmlzY2hiYWNoLCBBbmRyZWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Fischbach, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG92ZWxsLCBKb2huIFQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Lovell, John T'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhcmJlbCwgVGltb3RoeSBG', 'prefLabel': 'Sharbel, Timothy F'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Seed size, endosperm and germination variation in sexual and apomictic Boechera']",2025-04-16T15:23:59.518+0200,325.0

Across plant species, pollen morphological diversity is broadly linked to different pollination systems. However, the extent of within-species diversity is less well understood. To address this question, we explored pollen and anther diversity in rye (Secale cereale L.), a wind-pollinating grass species. RESULTS: We analysed 339 domesticated, feral and wild rye individuals of 64 diverse accessions. Population structure analysis revealed a differentiation gradient from wild to domesticated rye. We found pronounced within-species diversity of pollen and anther morphology. Genome-wide association scans uncovered a polygenic architecture of pollen and anther traits, with medium to high heritability and mostly small-effect loci. A subset of these loci overlapped with previously identified domestication loci, for which the underlying traits were unknown. A P(ST)-F(ST) analysis suggests that pollen and anther traits were under selection throughout rye domestication. Population genomic analyses revealed signatures of selection at 37% of all identified loci. CONCLUSION: Our work shows that selection for larger pollen grains and longer anthers occurred throughout rye domestication.

Comparative transcriptomics analysis of the grain coats was performed at two stages of development: the milk stage, when the hulls can still be easily detached from the pericarp, and the dough stage when the hull adhesion process occurs. It was shown that the main differences in the transcriptomes lie in the genes related to DNA replication and chromatin assembly, cell wall organization, and cuticle formation.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to analyse sleep quality in Spanish university professors and to determine its association with lifestyle habits and physical and mental health indicators. METHOD: The study was carried out on a sample of 1560 university professors (47.39\u2009±\u200911.29 years) from thirteen universities belonging to the Spanish Network of Health Promoting Universities. Sleep quality, emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, self-fulfilment, quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression, vocal fatigue, sedentary time and eating behaviour were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of university professors were found to have poor sleep quality (95% CI: 30.7% - 35.3%). Significant differences were identified based on sociodemographic factors, particularly gender, with 74.9% of men reporting good sleep quality compared to 50.5% of women. According to the regression analysis, sleep problems were associated with less improvement in vocal symptoms after rest and lower quality of life scores. Additionally, they were linked to greater vocal fatigue, physical discomfort in the voice, female gender, and higher scores in mental health disorders (stress, anxiety, and depression).

In the tissues of the ankle joints of mice with acute arthritis, the results of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot experiments suggested that AKK PROBIO may inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the tissues. AKK PROBIO can also regulate gut microbiota, inhibit harmful bacteria, and enhance valeric acid in the intestine, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid. Therefore, it is evident that AKK PROBIO prevents acute gouty arthritis better than glucosamine sulfate. It is a strain that has probiotic potential.']",public,['12(10):7644-7656'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIFhpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Xin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmh1LCBOYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Na'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIFh1ZXBpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Xueping'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6867-2012', 'prefLabel': 'wang, wei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFdlbnpob25n', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Wenzhong'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Research on preventive effect of Akkermansia muciniphila AKK PROBIO on acute gouty arthritis in mice'],2025-03-06T12:50:33.302+0100,286.0

Feasibility studies show behavior change interventions can increase physical activity participation, but face barriers (e.g., home visits or internet access). Low-cost telehealth approaches, like telephone calls, may overcome these challenges. Another low-cost strategy involves motivational tools supporting “Behavioral Regulation,” such as physical activity monitors. However, evidence is insufficient to support their use in increasing physical activity levels post-stroke. A systematic review suggests integrating these devices into multifaceted behavior change interventions (e.g., the 5As brief intervention outlined in the HEARTS Technical Package) may enhance their effectiveness. Combined with physical activity monitors and telephone follow-up, this approach has proven feasible for individuals post-stroke. These findings underscore the need to explore combining the 5As brief intervention with physical activity monitors to assess potential added benefits. This feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) study will investigate whether the telehealth intervention (by telephone call) combining the 5As brief intervention, as outlined in the HEARTS Technical Package, and physical activity monitoring, compared to a control group receiving only the 5As brief intervention, is feasible and supports a fully powered RCT. METHODS: A feasibility RCT study, with blinded assessment, will assign 24 individuals post-stroke (diagnosed ≥\u20096 months), aged ≥\u200918 years, inactive, able to walk 10 meters independently, and medically approved for physical activity, to experimental (n\u2009=\u200912) or control group (n\u2009=\u200912). Both groups will undergo the 5As brief intervention (Ask, Advise, Assess, and Assist delivered face-to-face, and Arrange via telephone call follow-up), for 12 weeks, with the experimental group also using a physical activity monitor. Outcomes include feasibility of recruitment, intervention, measurement, and blinding the outcome assessor, cost and clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: The intervention aligns with stroke secondary prevention recommendations and utilizes low-cost telehealth approaches.

Throughout Europe, more than 400 collections conserve PGR of over 6,500 genera, with over 2 million accessions documented in the European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO). To make these resources available to breeders, more research investment in these collections is needed. Here, we analyze the participation of European genebanks in collaborative projects within the EU Horizon scheme as an indicator for the use of PGR collections in research. We highlight two Horizon projects, AGENT and G2P-SOL, and the ECPGR initiative European Evaluation Network (EVA), which have brought together genebanks and other stakeholders to create tools and knowledge on PGR.

To better establish their relationship in trigeminal neuropathic pain, we examined male rats with infraorbital nerve (ION) ligation. Rats with ION ligation were administered CGRP or anti-CGRP antibody into the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The change in the head-withdrawal threshold was measured using von Frey filament. Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) was also performed in the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc). CGRP was detected in the TG and Vc by immunohistochemical staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the TG and dopamine D2 receptor in the Vc were detected in the same way. Antibody administration restored the head-withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli, which had decreased after ION ligation. Furthermore, the number of pERK-immunoreactive (-IR) neurons in the Vc, which increased following ION ligation, declined. The ratio of CGRP-IR TG neurons, large-sized CGRP-IR TG neurons, and TG neurons encircled with the GFAP-IR cells increased after ION ligation and decreased after antibody administration. Moreover, the immunoreactivity of CGRP and D2 receptor in the Vc increased after ION ligation and decreased after antibody administration. There were no significant differences in the head-withdrawal threshold, pERK-IR cell count, ratio of CGRP-IR TG neurons, ratio of size of CGRP-IR TG neurons, ratio of TG neurons encircled with GFAP-IR cells, and immunoreactivity of CGRP and D2 receptor in the Vc between the ION-ligated rats with and without CGRP.

The interplay between the intestinal microbiota and metabolites is believed to influence brain function and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions through the microbe–gut–brain axis. Sika deer antler protein possesses neuroprotective properties; however, the precise mechanism by which it improves AD remains unclear. Sika deer antler protein ameliorated AD in vivo by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The metabolome of brain and intestinal tissues and the microbiota of intestinal contents were tested and analyzed according to the microbe-gut-brain theory. Sika deer antler protein increased beneficial bacterial levels and decreased harmful bacterial levels. Correlation analyses using the gut flora–metabolomics pathway ultimately revealed that sika deer antler protein modulated the brain and intestinal tract bi-directionally via the tyrosine metabolism pathway, thereby establishing a connection within the microbe–gut–brain axis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the differential metabolite targets of the DAP4 group showed that the enriched pathways mainly included PI3K/AKT, which was consistent with the findings of the pharmacodynamic mechanisms observed in in vivo experiments. This suggests that antler protein may be involved in microbe-gut-brain interactions through tyrosine metabolism and may improve AD by activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Finally, GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and the predicted mechanisms were validated through molecular docking and cell experiments. 85 targets for G.\u2009pentaphyllum and 1556 for Hyperlipidemia were screened, with 53 common targets. Twenty-four active ingredients of G.\u2009pentaphyllum were found to be involved in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Key nodes such as Rhamnazin, Isofucosterol, and quercetin, and targets NCOA2, NR3C2, PGR, and PPARG showed high relevance. In the PPI network, 8 nodes, including IL6, PPARG, and VEGFA, exhibited high centrality. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated that G.\u2009pentaphyllum may treat hyperlipidemia by influencing various biological functions and pathways, such as DNA-binding transcription factor binding, RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding, and lipid and atherosclerosis. Cell experiments demonstrated that G.\u2009pentaphyllum significantly regulated the expression of key proteins in the LOX1-PI3K-AKT-eNOS pathway, thereby improving hyperlipidemia. G.\u2009pentaphyllum improves hyperlipidemia by mediating the LOX1-PI3K-AKT-eNOS pathway. This study provides a new theoretical basis and experimental evidence for applying G.\u2009pentaphyllum to treating hyperlipidemia.']",public,['12(10):8000-8012'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-6818-749X', 'prefLabel': 'Shen, Zhuyang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FvLCBYaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Gao, Xin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIERhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Dan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIFhpYW9qaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Xiaojin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlbiwgSmlhbnBpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Shen, Jianping'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The potential of Gynostemma pentaphyllum in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and its interaction with the LOX1-PI3K-AKT-eNOS pathway'],2025-03-17T12:57:12.726+0100,286.0

A total of 32 male mice, aged 12\u2009months, were divided into a control group and three treatment groups. These groups received varying daily doses of vitamin E for a period of 28\u2009days. The results showed significant improvements in cognitive function, specifically in working memory and spatial learning, in the groups that received vitamin E (100, 200, or 400\u2009mg/kg) compared to the control group. The markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities also demonstrated improvements, with higher doses of vitamin E showing greater effects. The analysis of gene expression revealed increased expression of SIRT1, Nrf2, and Calstabin2, particularly at higher doses of vitamin E. These findings suggest that vitamin E supplementation may help counteract age-related cellular changes. The study concludes that vitamin E supplementation can reduce oxidative stress, enhance cognitive function, and affect genetic markers of aging in mice, which may have therapeutic benefits in addressing age-related cognitive decline and oxidative damage.

Integrating pomegranate peel extract (PPE) into an effective nanocarrier system could enhance its mechanistic actions, potentially aiding in the remission of colitis. Therefore, this approach aimed to enhance PPE’s stability and bioavailability and investigate mitigating impact of pomegranate peel extract-loaded nanoparticles (PPE-NPs) in a colitis model. Colonic injury was induced by 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and efficacy of disease progression after oral administration of PPE-NPs for 14 days was assessed by evaluating clinical signs severity, antioxidant and inflammatory markers, expressions of endoplasmic reticulum associated genes and histopathological and immunostaining analysis in colonic tissues. Clinical signs and disease activity index were effectively reduced, and the levels of fecal calprotectin were decreased in groups treated with PPE-NPs compared to DSS group. The colitic group showed a significant increase (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO) (35.60, 163.30 and 280 nmol/g tissue respectively) and higher expression (P\u2009<\u20090.05) IL-17, TNF-α, and IL-1β (increased up to 2.99, 4.36 and 4.90 respectively unlike PPE-NPsIII that recorded reduced levels of CRP, MPO and NO (8,96, 78.30 and 123 nmol/g tissue respectively) and much lower (P\u2009<\u20090.05) levels of IL-17, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression (decreased to 1.23, 1.69 and 1.64, respectively).

Balancing between endoplasmic reticulum stressors (ERS), inflammation and autophagy was prominently noted in group treated with 150\u2009mg/kg of PPE-NPs. These findings were supported by subsiding the excessive expression of ERS related genes (CHOP, JUNK, ATF6, BIP, and Elf-2) and immunostaining expression regulation of key markers regulating autophagy (Beclin-2) in this group. The histopathological changes in the colon were less severe in the PPE-NPs received groups (especially at the level of 150\u2009mg/kg) compared to DSS group.

Unlike mountainous headwater catchments with shallow soils, lowland hydrology is typically dominated by groundwater dynamics, often exhibiting pronounced spatial correlation lengths, though other factors may also contribute. This necessitates consideration of distant anthropogenic impacts in water resources management. This study focuses on the Lusatia region in the northern German, a lowland area heavily altered by mining activities, including extensive groundwater lowering and rebound, impacting the overall water regime. We applied an efficient, data-based approach to unravel various impacts on the landscape water balance over a 30-year period (1993–2022). We integrated over 1800 ground-based time series data on groundwater levels, surface water dynamics and runoff, supplemented by evapotranspiration estimates from multi-temporal Landsat satellite data to account for land use effects. Through principal component analysis, we identified key patterns driving water balance dynamics. The first four components explained 84% of the variance in groundwater and surface water levels, as well as of runoff dynamics. The dominant processes attributed to these components include anthropogenic influences from mining activities, as well as natural hydrogeological effects such as seasonal variability and the damping of the groundwater recharge signal in the unsaturated zone. A separate principal component analysis that included evapotranspiration data explained 87% of the variance, with the first component predominantly reflecting seasonal variations and subsequent components elucidating land use impacts and long-term vegetation changes. By linking both analyses, we generated comprehensive maps detailing the spatial distribution of effects on regional water balance. Our approach provides a quantitative tool to assess the size and influence of natural and anthropogenic effects on water resources, offering a comprehensive tool for assessing spatial and temporal effects on hydrological dynamics in a lowland region affected by human activities.']",public,['39(1):e70053'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3LDtmNoZXIsIEplbm55', 'prefLabel': 'Kröcher, Jenny'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2hhemFyeWFuLCBHb2hhcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ghazaryan, Gohar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzY2hlaWQsIEd1bm5hcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lischeid, Gunnar'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Unravelling regional water balance dynamics in anthropogenically shaped lowlands: a data-driven approach'],2025-06-03T08:31:07.721+0200,333.0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of brimonidine prescriptions and the medical charts of patients who were administered brimonidine between 2019 and 2020. The participants were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of brimonidine allergy. Data on the demographic and clinical variables were collected for comparative analyses between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 12,024 brimonidine prescriptions were administered to 2,850 patients. Brimonidine allergy’s incidence was 5.5% (157 out of 2,850 patients). The median time from usage to the onset of allergic signs and symptoms was 32 weeks (interquartile range, 15–72 weeks). Conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that brimonidine allergy was associated with concurrent topical steroid use (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.87; p\u2009=\u20090.033), concurrent artificial tear use (OR = 3.07, 95%, CI, 1.36 to 6.93; p\u2009=\u20090.007), and concurrent tafluprost use (OR = 3.63, 95% CI, 1.04 to 12.63; p\u2009=\u20090.043.

In order to assess the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in these patients, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a thorough search in various databases, which included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ASCO Abstracts, ESMO Abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov. All relevant randomized controlled trials investigating the adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation in resected biliary tract cancer were identified. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcome was relapse-free survival (RFS). Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Additionally, publication bias was evaluated using Egger’s test in Stata 12.0. RESULTS: A total of 5 randomized controlled trials, involving 1406 patients, were included in this analysis. Compared with observation, adjuvant chemotherapy improved RFS [HR 0.84 (0.73-0.96), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.89) but not OS [HR 0.89 (0.77-1.03), p=0.12] (I2=51%, p=0.09) in the entire population after BTC resection. Subgroup analyses revealed that adjuvant chemotherapy did improve both OS [HR 0.76 (0.62-0.93), p=0.009] (I2=7%, p=0.37) and RFS [HR 0.74 (0.58-0.95), p=0.02] (I2=0%, p=0.39) in patients with lymph node positivity. Furthermore, patients receiving oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy showed benefit from the adjuvant therapy, with longer OS [HR 0.78 (0.65-0.94), p=0.009] (I2=2%, p=0.31) and RFS [HR 0.81 (0.68-0.95), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.95). CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, adjuvant chemotherapy have the potential to offer advantages in patients with resected BTC. Specifically, patients demonstrating positive lymph node status have a higher likelihood of benefiting from adjuvant therapy. Our analysis supports the current standard of care of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine. However, the recommendation of oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy as the preferred option is not definitive, as it is based on limited studies. Further validation of these outcomes is necessary by conducting extensive randomized controlled trials.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0295583'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGlhbiwgTGl5aW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Tian, Liying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBRaWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Qian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnUsIERhaWRp', 'prefLabel': 'Fu, Daidi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIFhpYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Xiao'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-4028-3240', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Linjun'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation in patients with resected biliary tract cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials'],2025-05-09T14:24:05.202+0200,337.0
frl:6511234,"['BACKGROUND: Home mold exposure is a commonly overlooked cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This is in part due to the limited literature supporting the association as well as the lack of exposure characterization available in reported cases. Notably, climate change, extreme weather patterns and frequent flooding continue to create conditions that promote home mold growth. As remediation has the potential to improve outcomes, clinicians need to remain vigilant in searching for and identifying potential mold exposure in suspected HP patients. The purpose of this study is to describe a large retrospective cohort of patients with home mold associated HP. METHODS: HP patients were identified retrospectively from our single center interstitial lung disease (ILD) database between 2011–2019. Patients with a moderate, high, or definite confidence diagnosis of HP were included. The presence of residential mold exposure was confirmed by medical chart review by a pulmonologist trained in exposure assessment. RESULTS: Home mold exposure was identified as the culprit antigen in 54 of 231 hypersensitivity pneumonitis patients. An invasive procedure (bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and/or surgical lung biopsy) was performed to confirm the diagnosis of HP in 85.7% of the cohort. Home mold was principally caused by chronic and/or recurring water intrusion. The most common locations of mold within the home included the bathroom, bedroom, and air conditioning unit. Transplant free survival was 97.7 months, which did not differ from the 50 HP patients in our cohort with HP associated with a mold exposure outside the home or patients in our cohort with HP associated with avian antigen exposure. Of the 41 patients who removed the exposure, 5 (12.2%) had a\u2009>\u200910% improvement in FVC, including 4 with fibrotic HP. CONCLUSION: Our study is the largest to report an association between HP and home mold exposure and is the first report from the region of north Texas. As climate change continues to disrupt weather patterns causing storms and flooding in certain areas, clinicians should remain alert to the presence of mold and its potential contribution to development of HP.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0323093'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5834-459X', 'prefLabel': 'Adams, Traci'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVkbGljaCwgQ2FycmllIEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Redlich, Carrie A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhemVyLCBDcmFpZyBTLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Glazer, Craig S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VsYXRpLCBNcmlkdQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Gulati, Mridu'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with home mold exposure: A retrospective cohort analysis'],2025-05-09T09:03:35.550+0200,337.0
frl:6511227,"['BACKGROUND: Fear of severe adverse reaction (SAR) and reluctance of health care providers to administer intramuscular injections are major contributing factors to poor adherence of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) in the management of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). However, data on the risk of SARs following BPG injections for RHD are relatively limited and inconclusive. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the incidence of SARs associated with BPG injections used for secondary prophylaxis of RHD. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant studies reporting adverse reactions following BPG injections in patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and/or RHD. A random effect meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled incidence of SARs. RESULT: Nine studies (eight cohort and one randomized controlled trial), comprising 11,587 participants and\u2009>\u2009154,760 BPG injections, were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence of SARs was 9.7 per 10,000 cases (95% CI: 0.1–29.2) and 1.1 per 10,000 BPG injections (95% CI: 0.4–2.2). Six fatal reactions were reported (0.05% of patients and 24% of SARs), all occurring in patients with severe RHD. CONCLUSION: SARs following BPG injections in patients with ARF or RHD are rare. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing the low rate of SARs against the benefits of BPG in secondary prophylaxis for RHD, particularly in high-risk populations. High-quality longitudinal research and comprehensive adverse reaction reporting are essential to address safety concerns among healthcare providers and patients that impact BPG delivery.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0322873'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7613-0384', 'prefLabel': 'Birru, Eshetie Melese'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxlbmUsIEtlZnlhbGV3IEFkZGlz', 'prefLabel': 'Alene, Kefyalew Addis'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4334-5351', 'prefLabel': 'Manning, Laurens'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmF0dHksIEtldmluIFQu', 'prefLabel': 'Batty, Kevin T.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9vcmUsIEJyaW9uaSBSLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Moore, Brioni R.'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Severe adverse reactions to benzathine penicillin G in rheumatic heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis'],2025-05-08T13:46:02.099+0200,337.0

The effectiveness of probiotics in reducing inflammatory damage in MS. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was the potential effectiveness of probiotics in reducing Multiple Sclerosis progression in preclinical and clinical studies. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched using multiple relevant keywords, and screening was carried out based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria from January 2004 to August 16, 2024. RESULTS: Based on our criteria, 269 papers were obtained, and after omission of unsuitable articles, 23 full-text articles consisting of 17 animal studies and six human models were selected. It was concluded that in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model, probiotics such as Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus can decrease the T helper 1 (Th1)/Th17 ratio while inducing interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-17 levels. In all cases, probiotics can modulate immune cells and cytokines and consequently decrease EAE signs and symptoms. In all human studies, single or multiple probiotics decreased the severity of disease and changed the gut microbiota population.

To guide future education efforts, this study assessed anaphylaxis awareness among adults in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey assessed knowledge among 380 adults using a validated questionnaire. Convenience sampling was used with data collected via online platforms. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations were tested. We analyzed the data using SPSS software. RESULTS: Knowledge was suboptimal, with a mean score of 34.5/60. Most identified the anaphylaxis definition (76.1%) and rapid symptom onset (78.9% within minutes). But just 37.9% recognized epinephrine as a first-line treatment and only 17.4% had auto-injector training. Nearly half (48.4%) needed to learn the proper EpiPen injection site. Under half understood the need for long-term allergen avoidance. Older age, more education, and Job status were associated with higher scores. CONCLUSION: This study reveals critical gaps in anaphylaxis knowledge among adults in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Poor understanding of emergency treatment and long-term management highlights the urgent need for improved public awareness. Targeted educational initiatives must emphasize prompt epinephrine administration, proper auto-injector use, and allergen avoidance.

To investigate this association, we analyzed data from 1,493 individuals across 145 families, encompassing both ET-positive (ET+) and ET-negative (ET−) participants. Using comprehensive statistical methods, including survival function estimation and regression modeling, we examined the potential influence of ET on lifespan. The median age of our participants was 67 years (IQR 54–77). Among deceased individuals, those with ET had a higher median age at death (80 years, IQR 70–86) compared to their ET− counterparts (70 years, IQR 59–77). Living ET+ participants also demonstrated slightly higher median ages (63 years, IQR 53–74) than living ET− individuals (60 years, IQR 49–71). Survival analysis revealed a significantly prolonged lifespan for ET+ individuals compared to ET− individuals (log-rank p =\u2009 1.11 ×\u2009 10\u2009⁻23). Furthermore, hazard ratio (HR) calculations indicated a reduced risk of mortality for the ET+ group (HR =\u2009 0.44, CI95% =\u2009 0.37–0.52), particularly among males. These findings suggest that ET may be associated with increased longevity, though the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

This study aimed to conduct a second survey to investigate in more detail the internet use in health context and digital technology use for health promotion and disease prevention in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional, nationwide telephone survey was conducted in November 2022. Anonymous data on internet and digital technology use, digital health literacy, and sociodemographic characteristics were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: The 1020 participants were aged 18–92 years, 53% were male, 62% completed primary or secondary education, 71% resided in large cities, and 45% reported a country-average net household income. Overall, 61% reported internet use in health context via 1–4 devices. Among those, more than 50% used the internet and apps to obtain general health information and less than 50% used digital technologies for physical activity promotion or cancer prevention. Overall, 34% were confident in using the internet for health decisions and 71% preferred to receive health information non-digitally (e.g. on paper). Internet, app, and digital technology use were associated with higher digital health literacy and income, and residence in larger cities. Digital technologies were used for physical activity promotion by younger and for cancer prevention by older participants. CONCLUSION: The internet and digital technologies were predominantly used to obtain health information, but less often for health promotion and disease prevention in 2022 in Germany. While health app and digital technology use for physical activity promotion increased, the confidence in using online information for health decisions decreased in 2022 relative to 2020.

AIMS: We aimed to characterize the use of such drugs in lung cancer patients based on longitudinal analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the GePaRD database (claims data from ~20% of the German population) we identified lung cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 based on a previously developed algorithm and followed them until death, end of continuous insurance, or end of 2019. We determined the proportion of patients treated with at least one of the drugs under study (EGFR, ALK, and BRAF inhibitors). We described these patients regarding demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival. We included 7833 incident lung cancer patients. Of these, 392 (5%) were treated with one of the drugs under study, the majority (62%) being female. In 314 out of the 392 patients (80%), the first dispensation was an EGFR inhibitor (afatinib: 54%, erlotinib: 33%), and in 72 patients (18%), it was an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib: 90%). The proportion of patients treated with these drugs was 4.8% in West Germany and 6.2% in East Germany. About half of these patients had chemotherapy before targeted therapy. Median overall survival after the first targeted therapy was 22\u2009months. CONCLUSION: One twentieth of lung cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 in Germany received at least one EGFR, ALK, or BRAF inhibitor during follow-up.

Wir setzen hiermit einen Schwerpunkt für die eigene Ausrichtung unseres Bundesinstituts. In die Strategie wurden Anregungen und Ideen der Netzwerkveranstaltung „FeMaLe – Frauen und Mädchen im Leistungssport“ (30.–31. Mai 2023, Sport- & Olympia-Museum, Köln) integriert. Zu der Auftaktveranstaltung hatten wir Expertinnen und Experten aus der Wissenschaft und Sportpraxis sowie Vertreterinnen und Vertreter des Bundesministeriums des Innern und für Heimat (BMI), der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Sportmedizin und Prävention (DGSP), der Deutschen Vereinigung für Sportwissenschaft (dvs), des Instituts für Angewandte Trainingswissenschaft (IAT), des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes (DOSB) und von Athleten Deutschland e. V. zum intensiven Austausch geladen. Der erste Teil des Strategiepapiers fokussiert die Ziele, Themenschwerpunkte und Maßnahmen, die vom BISp selbst in den kommenden Jahren verfolgt und umgesetzt werden sollen. Im zweiten Teil, dem Aktionsplan, sind zudem Maßnahmen verzeichnet, die das BISp im Verbund mit weiteren Akteurinnen und Akteuren initiieren möchte. Der Aktionsplan ist als ein „living document“ zu verstehen, das ebenso wie die Schwerpunktthemen kontinuierlich verändert, angepasst und erweitert werden kann. Das BISp ist sich der geschlechtlichen und sexuellen Vielfalt der Akteurinnen und Akteure im Sport bewusst. Benachteiligungen und Einschränkungen, die Frauen und Mädchen im Sport erleben und die über vorliegende Strategie reduziert werden sollen, treffen ebenso und meist verstärkt auf transgender- und nicht-binäre Personen zu. Das Sport- und Wettkampfsystem des organisierten Sports und vor allem der paralympischen und olympischen Sportarten ist jedoch weiterhin durch die Zweiteilung der Wettkampfstruktur in Jungen und Mädchen bzw. Frauen und Männer geprägt. Daher zielt die vorliegende Strategie auf Frauen und Mädchen im Sport, ohne die vorliegende Problematik von transgender- und nicht-binären Personen auszuklammern. Dabei ist dem BISp bewusst, dass sich häufig verschiedene Diskriminierungsformen überschneiden und potenzieren und nicht isoliert vorkommen (Stichwort Intersektionalität). Ein sensibler Umgang und ein stetiges Mitdenken der Themen Diversity und Intersektionalität wird daher angestrebt.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Bundesinstitut für Sportwissenschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/10041398-5'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/ger', 'label': 'Deutsch', 'prefLabel': 'Deutsch'}]",['Strategiepapier – Frauen und Mädchen im Sport'],2025-05-19T08:39:15.559+0200,339.0

These measurements were performed under two conditions: 1.5% isoflurane (which has a long-term vasodilator effect) or 100 µg/kg medetomidine (which has a long-term vasoconstrictor effect). The stimulation elicited a short period of neuronal afterdischarges (nAD) followed by a sustained decline in fMRI BOLD signals, as previously described (Arboit et al., 2024). While the duration of nAD was similar in presence of isoflurane and medetomidine, the subsequent decline of BOLD signal was significantly longer with isoflurane than with medetomidine. However, when the same experiments were performed in the presence of acetaminophen, the duration of the sustained decline of BOLD signals became similar: acetaminophen significantly prolonged the decline in the presence of medetomidine, whereas it only slightly shortened it in the presence of isoflurane. As acetaminophen did not affect the generation and intensity of nAD, the results indicate that nAD activates at least two different neurovascular coupling (NVC) mechanisms that mediate the sustained BOLD signal decline, of which acetaminophen affects the maintenance.

The data included 211 gut microbial taxa, consumption levels of nine artificially sweetened foods, and seven types of chronic pain. The primary statistical method used was inverse variance weighting (IVW). We explored whether gut microbiota mediate the relationship between artificially sweetened foods and chronic pain. We found that genetic predisposition to consuming artificially sweetened foods is associated with an increased risk of chronic pain through different types of gut microbiota. Two-step MR suggests the mediating effects of four gut microbiota on three chronic pain: head and neck pain, joint pain, and sciatica. These findings could inform interventions and treatments for chronic pain.

frl:6506451,"['T cells exhibit remarkable developmental plasticity, forming various functional subsets with distinct roles in immune defense. Their differentiation follows two primary pathways: homeostatic development in primary lymphoid organs, ensuring a self-tolerant immune repertoire, and adaptive differentiation in secondary or tertiary lymphoid organs in response to infections, chronic diseases, and environmental changes. Research suggests that T cell subsets represent a continuum of flexible states rather than fixed categories, allowing them to acquire new functions based on immune challenges. The CRC 1054 research initiative aimed to explore the determinants of this plasticity in both precursor cell development and mature immune responses. A key focus is understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic signals shape immune cell fate. For example, T cell receptor (TCR) signaling plays a dual role: guiding survival decisions in immature T cells while orchestrating effector differentiation in mature ones. Unraveling these mechanisms provides valuable insights for translational medicine and targeted immune therapies. During its first funding period (2013-2016), CRC 1054 examined T cell differentiation and signaling, identifying critical roles for antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways. The discovery of a pharmacological MALT-1 inhibitor demonstrated the potential for manipulating immune cell fate for therapeutic purposes. The second funding phase (2017-2020) deepened understanding of early thymocyte development and mature T cell differentiation into effector and memory cells. Interdisciplinary efforts in crystallography and pharmacology led to the refinement of MALT-1 inhibitors, setting the stage for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The third funding period (2021-2024) focused on two research areas: homeostatic differentiation and adaptive cell-fate decisions. While fundamental research remained central, preclinical studies in autoimmune disease, infection, and vaccination models were intensified. Additionally, projects involving human T cells have been incorporated to enhance translational research. Looking back, CRC 1054 aimed and succeeded to further elucidate immune cell-fate decisions, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to reprogram immune responses for disease treatment and prevention.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Brocker, Thomas', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1377882888'}, {'prefLabel': 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2002585-3'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2007744-0'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'label': 'Englisch', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Control and plasticity of cell-fate decisions in the immune system'],2025-02-06T11:16:25.153+0100,338.0

Gibberellins (GAs), as key regulators of plant growth and development, hold significant potential for enhancing these traits in soybean. In this study, previously developed GmNMHC5 mutant lines were utilized to assess GA levels, photosynthetic capacity, carbohydrate and nitrogen accumulation, as well as yield and quality characteristics during the seed-filling stage. Knockout of GmNMHC5 was found to enhance endogenous GA biosynthesis, resulting in increased plant height and improved carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These physiological changes contributed to significant increases in both seed weight and size, leading to higher accumulation of carbohydrate and protein reserves in mature seeds. Although total seed yield remained unchanged, protein yield per plant was significantly elevated in the GmNMHC5 knockout line. In contrast, overexpression of GmNMHC5 led to reduced GA levels, decreased plant height, and diminished aboveground dry matter accumulation, ultimately lowering protein yield. These findings indicate that targeted knockout of GmNMHC5 can enhance protein yield in soybean by modulating GA levels and optimizing carbon–nitrogen allocation.

frl:6510178,"['BACKGROUND: and purpose Combining inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor and the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) pathway has shown efficacy in multiple cancers, but the disease-specific and agent-specific mechanisms of benefit remain unclear. We examined the efficacy and defined the mechanisms of benefit when combining regorafenib (a multikinase antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor) with PD1 blockade in murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models. BASIC PROCEDURES: We used orthotopic models of HCC in mice with liver damage to test the effects of regorafenib—dosed orally at 5, 10 or 20\u2009mg/kg daily—combined with anti-PD1 antibodies (10\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally thrice weekly). We evaluated the effects of therapy on tumor vasculature and immune microenvironment using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, ELISA and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in mice and in tissue and blood samples from patients with cancer. MAIN FINDINGS: Regorafenib/anti-PD1 combination therapy increased survival compared with regofarenib or anti-PD1 alone in a regorafenib dose-dependent manner. Combination therapy increased regorafenib uptake into the tumor tissues by normalizing the HCC vasculature and increasing CD8 T-cell infiltration and activation at an intermediate regorafenib dose. The efficacy of regorafenib/anti-PD1 therapy was compromised in mice lacking functional T cells (Rag1-deficient mice). Regorafenib treatment increased the transcription and protein expression of CXCL10—a ligand for CXCR3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes—in murine HCC and in blood of patients with HCC. Using Cxcr3-deficient mice, we demonstrate that CXCR3 mediated the increased intratumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration and the added survival benefit when regorafenib was combined with anti-PD1 therapy.

frl:6510046,"['Nature-based Solutions (NbS) build synergies between biodiversity conservation and societal challenges such as climate change. This paper derives a working definition of NbS based on an evaluation of existing definitions, in particular the IUCN (2016) definition. It comprises the key elements of the existing definitions that we believe to be important to inform the scope of this study. It critically assesses the global mitigation potential of NbS in relevant studies for forests, croplands, grasslands, terrestrial and coastal wetlands as well as settlements. Recommendations for international climate policy are derived. The study finds that it is likely that NbS potentials provided by scientific literature overestimate the realistic potential of NbS for climate change mitigation. This is due to a lack of integrated studies, overly optimistic assumptions on land availability as well as the quality of available information. Furthermore, the influence of measures on GHG fluxes, uncertainties related to carbon fluxes and quantification methodologies as well as climate impacts are not taken into account. The majority of studies evaluating the mitigation potential of NbS focus on the technical mitigation potential. General ecological constraints such as existing threats to ecosystems, and biodiversity impacts, land use conflicts and other social, cultural and political barriers as well as the risk of non-permanence further limit mitigation potentials. The success of NbS to mitigate climate change and deliver ecological and social co-benefits will very much depend on eliminating direct and indirect pressures on ecosystems caused by current patterns of production and consumption. Nevertheless, the uncertainties related to the quantification of mitigation effects of NbS should not be used as an argument against their implementation. Neither should they be used as an excuse to delay ambitious mitigation action to reduce emissions. In the UNFCCC negotiation process, information on NbS in biennial transparency reports may serve as a basis for technical discussion to improve methodologies and indicators to assess how NbS contribute to achieving NDCs and to make further financial support available. In implementing activities under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the specific risks related to NbS must be taken into account. In the development of processes or support schemes to foster NbS, social and environmental safeguards need to be put in place. Coherence with work under other international policy frameworks such as the other Rio Conventions is required to foster synergies.', 'Naturbasierte Lösungen (NbS) schaffen Synergien zwischen dem Schutz der Biodiversität und gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen wie dem Klimawandel. In diesem Papier wird eine Arbeitsdefinition von NbS abgeleitet, die sich auf andere bestehende Definitionen, insbesondere auf die Definition der IUCN (2016) stützt. Sie enthält zentrale Elemente der bestehenden Definitionen, die für den Rahmen dieser Studie wichtig sind. Das globale Minderungspotenzial von NbS in relevanten Studien für Wälder, Ackerland, Grünland, terrestrische und küstennahe Feuchtgebiete sowie Siedlungen wird kritisch analysiert und es werden Empfehlungen für die internationale Klimapolitik abgeleitet. Die Studie kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur angegebenen Potenziale das realistische Potenzial von NbS für den Klimaschutz wahrscheinlich überschätzen. Dies ist auf das Fehlen integrierter Studien, zu optimistische Annahmen zur Flächenverfügbarkeit und die Qualität der verfügbaren Informationen zurückzuführen. Außerdem werden der Einfluss von Maßnahmen auf Treibhausgasflüsse, Unsicherheiten in Bezug auf Kohlenstoffflüsse und Quantifizierungsmethoden sowie Klimawandelauswirkungen nicht berücksichtigt. Die Mehrzahl der Studien, die das Minderungspotenzial von NbS untersuchen, konzentriert sich auf das technische Minderungspotenzial. Allgemeine ökologische Einschränkungen wie bestehende Bedrohungen für Ökosysteme, Auswirkungen auf die Biodiversität, Landnutzungskonflikte und andere soziale, kulturelle und politische Hindernisse sowie das Risiko der Nicht-Permanenz von Minderungserfolgen schränken die Minderungspotenziale weiter ein. Der Beitrag von NbS bei der Bekämpfung des Klimawandels und der Erzielung ökologischer und sozialer Co-Benefits wird in hohem Maße davon abhängen, ob die direkten und indirekten Belastungen der Ökosysteme aufgrund der vorherrschenden Produktions- und Konsummuster beseitigt werden. Dennoch sollten die Unsicherheiten in Bezug auf die Quantifizierung der Minderungseffekte von NbS nicht als Argument gegen ihre Umsetzung verwendet werden. Sie sollten auch nicht als Vorwand dienen, um ehrgeizige Minderungsmaßnahmen zur Reduzierung von Emissionen zu verzögern. Im Rahmen des UNFCCC-Verhandlungsprozesses können die Informationen über NbS in den zweijährlichen Transparenzberichten als Grundlage für technische Diskussionen dienen, um Methoden und Indikatoren von NbS im Kontext der NDCs weiterzuentwickeln, und um finanzielle Unterstützung bereitzustellen. Bei der Umsetzung von Aktivitäten unter Artikel 6 des Übereinkommens von Paris müssen die spezifischen Risiken im Zusammenhang mit NbS berücksichtigt werden. Bei der Entwicklung von Verfahren oder Unterstützungsregelungen zur Förderung von NbS müssen soziale und ökologische Schutzmaßnahmen eingeführt werden. Zur Förderung von Synergien ist eine Kohärenz mit der Arbeit im Rahmen anderer internationaler politischer Rahmenwerke wie den anderen Rio-Konventionen erforderlich.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Reise, Judith', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1230500596'}, {'prefLabel': 'Siemons, Anne', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Siemons, Anne'}, {'prefLabel': 'Böttcher, Hannes', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/134053516'}, {'prefLabel': 'Herold, Anke', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1245173677'}, {'prefLabel': 'Urrutia, Cristina', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Urrutia, Cristina'}, {'prefLabel': 'Schneider, Lambert', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/136548431'}, {'prefLabel': 'Iwaszuk, Ewa', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Iwaszuk, Ewa'}, {'prefLabel': 'McDonald, Hugh', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/McDonald, Hugh'}, {'prefLabel': 'Frelih-Larsen, Ana', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Frelih-Larsen, Ana'}, {'prefLabel': 'Duin, Laurens', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Duin, Laurens'}, {'prefLabel': 'Davis, McKenna', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Davis, McKenna'}, {'prefLabel': 'Auerochs, Hannah', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Auerochs, Hannah'}, {'prefLabel': 'Erxleben, Friederike', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Erxleben, Friederike'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutschland.

Wir stellen fest, dass die Förderung klimafreundlicher Bodenbewirtschaftungsmaßnahmen mit diesen Finanzierungsansätzen ein erhebliches Potenzial, aber auch erhebliche Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Beide Ansätze haben Stärken und Schwächen. Angesichts der starken Nachfrage nach Kompensationsmöglichkeiten und der Zertifizierung von Klimaschutzmaßnahmen untersuchen wir zehn bestehende Kohlenstoffprogramme, die klimafreundliche Bodenbewirtschaftung zertifizieren und stellen dabei viele Mängel fest. Auf der Grundlage unserer Bewertungen erörtern wir die Angemessenheit der beiden Finanzierungsansätze zur Förderung verschiedener Arten von klimafreundlichen Bodenbewirtschaftungsmaßnahmen. Wir kommen zu dem Schluss, dass handlungsorientierte Förderansätze für viele Maßnahmen der klimafreundlichen Bodenbewirtschaftung geeignet sind, wobei ein hohes Risiko besteht, dass die erzielte Klimawirkung nicht dauerhaft bestehen bleibt. Ergebnisorientierte Finanzierungsansätze, die nicht auf Kompensation abzielen wie contribution claims und öffentliche Finanzierung für erzielte Ergebnisse sind für einige klimafreundliche Bodenbewirtschaftungsmaßnahmen am besten geeignet. Kompensationsansätze sind kein geeignetes Instrument für die Finanzierung klimafreundlicher Bodenbewirtschaftungsmaßnahmen.

We identify considerable potential but also significant challenges of promoting climate-friendly soil management measures with these funding approaches. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Given the interest in offsetting and other crediting approaches, we investigate ten existing carbon crediting mechanisms related to climate-friendly soil management in depth, identifying many shortcomings. Based on our evaluations, we discuss the appropriateness of the two funding approaches to promote different types of climate-friendly soil management measures. We conclude that action-based funding approaches are appropriate for many climate-friendly soil management measures, where non-permanence risks are widespread and must be considered. Result-based (non-offset) funding approaches such as contribution claims and public result-based finance are mostly appropriate for some climate-friendly soil management measures. Offsetting approaches are not an appropriate instrument for funding climate-friendly soil management measures due to environmental integrity concerns (i.e. they will lead to higher aggregate emissions than without using offsetting) arising from non-permanence, additionality, and quantification uncertainty.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Siemons, Anne', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Siemons, Anne'}, {'prefLabel': 'Schneider, Lambert', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/136548431'}, {'prefLabel': 'Jung, Hannes', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Jung, Hannes'}, {'prefLabel': 'McDonald, Hugh', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/McDonald, Hugh'}, {'prefLabel': 'Scheid, Aaron', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Scheid, Aaron'}, {'prefLabel': 'Frelih-Larsen, Ana', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Frelih-Larsen, Ana'}, {'prefLabel': 'Gattinger, Andreas', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/123281709'}, {'prefLabel': 'Niether, Wiebke', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Niether, Wiebke'}, {'prefLabel': 'Herzfeld, Tobias', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Herzfeld, Tobias'}, {'prefLabel': 'Erxleben, Friederike', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Erxleben, Friederike'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutschland.

Metabolomics could provide insights into the mechanisms linking their intake to adiposity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify metabolomics biomarkers of intake of low- and no-calorie sweetened beverages (LNCSBs), sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and ASs and to investigate their associations with body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference. METHODS: We analyzed 3 data sets from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) cohort study, of children who provided 2 urine samples (n = 297), adolescents who provided a single urine sample (n = 339), and young adults who provided a single plasma sample (n = 195). Urine and plasma were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Dietary intakes were assessed using 3-d weighed dietary records. The random forest, partial least squares, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were jointly used for metabolite selection. We examined associations of intakes with metabolites and anthropometric measures using linear and mixed-effects regression. RESULTS: In adolescents, LNCSB were positively associated with acesulfame (β: 0.0012; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0006, 0.0019) and saccharin (β: 0.0009; 95% CI: 0.0002, 0.0015). In children, the association was observed with saccharin (β: 0.0016; 95% CI: 0.0005, 0.0027). In urine and plasma, SSBs were positively associated with 1-methylxanthine (β: 0.0005; 95% CI: 0.0003, 0.0008; and β: 0.0010, 95% CI 0.0004, 0.0015, respectively) and 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (β: 0.0005; 95% CI: 0.0002, 0.0008; and β: 0.0009; 95% CI: 0.0003, 0.0014, respectively). AS was associated with urinary sucrose (β: 0.0095; 95% CI: 0.0069, 0.0121) in adolescents. Some of the food-related metabolomics profiles were also associated with adiposity measures.

Incorporating banana powder into cookie samples resulted in significant changes in the parameters studied. The banana flours’ total dietary fiber and total starch levels ranged between 1.37% and 3.43% and 34.82% and 41.38%, respectively. Erdemli type bananas (ER) were distinguished by their high dietary fiber and resistant starch content as well as their superior bioactive properties. Total phenolic content and antiradical activity of the cookie samples enriched with banana flour were in the range of 376–600\u2009mg GAE/kg, while the antiradical activity values ranged between 8.64% and 59.42%. The hardness of the cookie samples also ranged between 1664.5 and 2605.9\u2009g. According to the results of the optimization, 98.5% ER and 1.5% GN flour mixture could yield the highest response scores.

frl:6510724,"['BACKGROUND: People with the chronic disease Multiple Sclerosis are subjected to different degrees of profound uncertainty. Uncertainty has been linked to adverse psychological effects such as feelings of heightened vulnerability, avoidance of decision-making, fear, worry, anxiety disorders, and even depression. Research into Multiple Sclerosis has a predominant focus on the scientific, practical, and psychosocial issues of uncertainty. In comparison, existential uncertainty has been under-researched, even though it might pose a greater burden to those experiencing it. OBJECTIVE: To understand the lived experience of uncertainty for people living with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis. METHODS: This study followed a phenomenological research design, employing elements of both the Reflective Lifeworld Approach and Phenomenology of Practice. Seventeen people with a recent (<1 year) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis were included. In-depth interviews were conducted immediately after inclusion. RESULTS: The lived experience of uncertainty can be described as a stumbling motion across the liminal space between hope and grief while dealing with oscillating feelings of unrest concerning the body, self, and others. The following four constituents further illuminate the meaning of the phenomenon: Having to constantly (re)define unfamiliar and intangible bodily changes on one’s own; Unsteady navigating amidst a destabilization of the imagined life; Relating to others as a source of, mirror or buffer for uncertainty; Going through overwhelming fears and worries while clinging to one’s own logic. CONCLUSION: Adding to existing qualitative and phenomenological research into MS and theories on uncertainty, this study portrays uncertainty as a multifaceted experience. The findings imply the need for a continuous attunement of healthcare practitioners to the expectations, fears, avoidance techniques, and other uniquely personal circumstances of people with Multiple Sclerosis.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0315501'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8236-653X', 'prefLabel': 'van Reenen, Eva'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIE5pc3RlbHJvb2lqLCBJbmdlIEEuIE0u', 'prefLabel': 'van Nistelrooij, Inge A.

frl:6510659,"['BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence about how vocational rehabilitation (VR) for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be delivered through the United Kingdom’s (UK) National Health Service (NHS) and how it works. AIM: To understand the mechanisms and context for implementing a VR intervention for people with MS in the NHS and develop an explanatory programme theory. METHODS: A realist evaluation, including a review of evidence followed by semi-structured interviews. A realist review about VR for people with MS in the NHS was conducted on six electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE) with secondary purposive searches. Included studies were assessed for relevance and rigour. Semi-structured interviews with people with MS, employers, and healthcare professionals, were conducted remotely. Data were extracted, analysed, and synthesised to refine the programme theory and produce a logic model. RESULTS: Data from 13 studies, and 19 interviews (10 people with MS, five employers, and four healthcare professionals) contributed to producing the programme theory. The resulting programme theory explains the implementation of VR in the NHS for MS populations, uncovering the complex interplay between the healthcare and employment sectors to influence health and employment outcomes. VR programmes that offer timely support, tailored to the needs of the person with MS, and that support and empower the employee beyond the healthcare context are most likely associated with improved employment outcomes, for example, job retention. CONCLUSION: Embedding VR support within the NHS requires substantial cultural and organisational change (e.g., increased staff numbers, training, and awareness about the benefits of work). This study emphasises the need to routinely identify people with MS at risk of job loss and follow a collaborative approach to address employment issues. This realist evaluation provides insight on how to improve the quality of care available to people with MS.\r\n']",public,['20(2):e0319287'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5621-9445', 'prefLabel': 'De Dios Perez, Blanca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9vdGgsIFZpY2t5', 'prefLabel': 'Booth, Vicky'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGFzIE5haXIsIFJvc2hhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'das Nair, Roshan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXZhbmdlbG91LCBOaWtvcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Evangelou, Nikos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzc2FyZCwgSnVsaWV0', 'prefLabel': 'Hassard, Juliet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Rm9yZCwgSGVsZW4gTC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ford, Helen L.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1401-3075', 'prefLabel': 'Newsome, Ian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFkZm9yZCwgS2F0ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Radford, Kate'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Vocational rehabilitation for people with multiple sclerosis in the national health service of the United Kingdom: A realist evaluation'],2025-03-14T10:18:22.821+0100,337.0
frl:6510647,"['OBJECTIVE: To summarize the existing evidence from double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies regarding the effects of biologic agents for the treatment of large vessel vasculitis (LVV). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov covering the period from database inception to May 3rd, 2023. Double-blind RCTs and cohort studies reporting biologic therapies’ effects on LVV including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu’s arteritis (TAK) with outcomes of interest in English were included. The primary outcome of interest was relapse rates during glucocorticoid tapering. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 and the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool were used for the quality assessment. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 4599 references retrieved, 10 RCTs regarding GCA, 6 cohort studies, and 2 RCTs regarding TAK were included, comprising 997 participants in total. All the included RCTs were of low risk of bias, while the 6 cohort studies were of moderate to serious risk of bias. Meta-analysis suggested a significant superiority of biologic agents in prolonging relapse-free survival, increasing glucocorticoid taper rate, and decreasing cumulative glucocorticoids dose for both GCA and TAK. Additionally, GCA patients using biologic agents had significantly lower relapse rates and ESR levels with higher remission rates. Trends of favoring biologic agents in reducing relapse rate, ITAS-2010, ITAS-A, ESR, and CRP along with increased remission rate for TAK were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic agents significantly improved clinical outcomes in LVV by reducing relapse rates, enhancing remission, and enabling safer glucocorticoid tapering, offering an important therapeutic advantage for managing both GCA and TAK.

The goals of this study were to investigate the role of the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genes (for the first time) in Jordanian MS patients and their association with MS disease. The association of these genes with other clinical features, such as optic neuritis, sensory impairment, and brainstem symptoms in MS patients was investigated as well using PCR-SSP techniques. Our findings indicated an association between HLA-DRB1\u2009*\u200903:01 (Pc =\u2009 0.01) and HLA-DRB1\u2009*\u200904:01 (Pc =\u2009 0.004) alleles with Jordanian MS patients.

These diseases exist due to spreading of infected ticks. A large number of cattle were found to suffer from mixed infections caused by the three parasites at the same time. Due to these reasons cattle have been devoid of milk production with reduced meat availability. Hence, it is a matter of urgency for the immunity of cattle to exhibit resilience against all three rickettsial parasites. It could be possible if trials are carried out after producing a subunit chimeric vaccine against the rickettsial protozoan parasites and introducing it into the bloodstream of the cattle species. In this paper, we have used the process of reverse vaccinology to conduct a study in which we have developed a multi-epitope subunit chimeric vaccine against three protozoan parasites. We constructed three chimeric vaccine sequences from which only one chimeric vaccine construct was found to be an effective and efficient vaccine which is stable with high solubility and negative allergenicity. Following that, we performed molecular docking of the refined chimeric vaccine construct with Rp-105 and TLR-9. It was observed that the chimeric vaccines interacted with the receptors with high binding energy. Immune simulation was also performed to determine the potentiality of the chimeric vaccine for eliciting an immune response. The best-designed chimeric vaccine construct was then reverse transcribed and adapted for the host E. coli K12 strain which was later inserted into the pET28a (+) vector for the cloning and expression of the vaccine. The study could be a good initiative for the development of an effective chimeric vaccine against bovine parasites.']",public,['20(1):e0312262'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2990-4022', 'prefLabel': 'SIDDIKI, AMAM'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxhbSwgU2FicmVlbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Alam, Sabreena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnVhZCBCaW4gSG9zc2VuLCBGYXJoYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Fuad Bin Hossen, Farhan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxpbSwgTWQuIEFiZHVs', 'prefLabel': 'Alim, Md.

We assessed the effectiveness of CCP in a propensity-matched analysis, and whether the presence of antibodies in the recipient at the time of treatment or the titer of antibodies in the administered CCP influenced clinical effectiveness. In an inpatient population within a single large health system, a total of 290 CCP patients were matched to 290 controls. While CCP increased titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG titers post-CCP (p = <0.0001), no differences in 30-day survival were observed between CCP patients and controls in univariate and multivariate analyses. Survival at 30 days was numerically lower in recipients who were seronegative prior to CCP administration, compared to those with low titer and high titer anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG, respectively, but did not reach statistical significance (56% vs 82% vs 75%, p = 0.16).

frl:6510630,"['PURPOSE: Angiopoietin (Ang) 2 is released from vascular endothelial cells by the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A. Ang2 increases the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules on endothelial cells via nuclear factor κB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ang2 and VEGFA on ocular autoimmune inflammation. METHODS: We measured the concentrations of Ang2 and VEGFA in vitreous samples among patients with uveitis. Vitreous samples were collected from 16 patients with idiopathic uveitis (uveitis group) and 16 patients with non-inflammatory eye disease (control group). Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) was induced in B10.BR mice with a human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-derived peptide. The retinochoroidal tissues of the EAU mice were removed, and the mRNA levels of Ang2 and VEGFA were examined. EAU mice treated with anti-Ang2, anti-VEGFA, a combination of anti-Ang2 and anti-VEGFA, anti-Ang2/VEGFA bispecific, or IgG control antibodies were clinically and histopathologically evaluated. RESULTS: The protein levels of Ang2 and VEGFA were significantly higher in the vitreous samples of patients with uveitis than in controls (P<0.05). The retinochoroidal mRNA levels of Ang2 and VEGFA were significantly upregulated in EAU mice compared to controls (n = 6, P<0.05). Although there was no significant difference, treatment with anti-VEGFA antibody reduced the clinical and histopathological scores. However, treatment with anti-Ang2 antibody reduced the clinical and histopathological scores (n = 18–20, P<0.05). Furthermore, these scores were further decreased when treated by inhibiting both Ang2 and VEGFA. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, VEGFA and Ang2 were shown to be upregulated locally in the eye of both uveitis patients and models of uveitis. Dual inhibition of Ang2 and VEGFA is suggested to be a new therapeutic strategy for uveitis.\r\n']",public,['18(11):e0294745'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3V6dWtpLCBLYXlv', 'prefLabel': 'Suzuki, Kayo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8105-4670', 'prefLabel': 'Iwata, Daiju'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmFtYmEsIEtlbmljaGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Namba, Kenichi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzZSwgS2VpdGFybw==', 'prefLabel': 'Hase, Keitaro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlyYW9rYSwgTWlraQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hiraoka, Miki'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVyYXRhLCBNaXl1a2k=', 'prefLabel': 'Murata, Miyuki'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2l0YWljaGksIE5vYnV5b3NoaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kitaichi, Nobuyoshi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Rm94dG9uLCBSaWNoYXJk', 'prefLabel': 'Foxton, Richard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXNoaWRhLCBTdXN1bXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Ishida, Susumu'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Involvement of Angiopoietin 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor in uveitis'],2025-03-13T10:29:32.705+0100,337.0
frl:6510414,"['OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of perilesional human recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFNα2b) for treatment of periocular squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) in horses. ANIMALS STUDIED: Eleven horses (12 eyes) with PSCC were enrolled in this prospective clinical study with owner consent. PROCEDURES: Systemically healthy horses were included in the study following confirmation of PSCC via biopsy. Every two weeks for a maximum of six treatments, horses were sedated and perilesional injection of IFNα2b (10 million IU) was performed. Tumors were measured prior to each injection and at one, three, and 12 months after treatment completion. A greater than 50% reduction in tumor size was considered positive response to treatment (i.e., partial or complete response). Development of anti-IFNα2b antibodies was assessed using serum samples obtained after treatment initiation and compared with treatment responses. Antibody concentrations were analyzed using a mixed model. Statistical significance was considered p < 0.05. RESULTS: Each horse received four to six perilesional injections of IFNα2b. Five of 12 eyes (4/11 horses) responded to treatment. Two of five eyes showed complete resolution of gross PSCC. No systemic adverse effects were seen. Local swelling occurred during treatment protocol in 6/11 horses but resolved without intervention. All horses developed serum anti-IFNα2b antibodies. There was no evidence of statistical difference in antibody concentration between responders and non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Perilesional administration of IFNα2b was found to be well-tolerated in horses with PSCC, and induced tumor regression in 42% of treated eyes.

The European Code Against Cancer (ECAC) is a health education tool to raise awareness about risk factors and evidence-based measures to prevent cancer. The ECAC 4th edition consists of 12 recommendations to reduce individuals’ cancer risk and related deaths. This study explores perceived barriers to adopting the cancer prevention actions recommended by the ECAC fourth edition in the European Union (EU). METHODS: The COM-B model of behaviour change will be used as a framework for the design and analysis of the study since it identifies factors (capability, opportunity, motivation) that need to be present for any behaviour change to occur. A qualitative study using an exploratory research methodology was designed to obtain information from adults with no previous cancer diagnosis by employing in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants are selected using a quota sampling strategy according to sex, age, and education level (18 profiles/country). Interviews will be conducted in participants’ native language by trained researchers. Afterward, a thematic content analysis will be conducted to identify common topics, followed by a critical analysis of their discourse. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to informing the fifth edition of the ECAC –currently under development; by providing insights on how EU citizens perceive the cancer prevention recommendations of the fourth edition and whether they can motivate them to change unhealthy behaviours. Additionally, the study will help to identify the main facilitators and barriers (perceived or already confronted) to adopt these cancer prevention recommendations so that this knowledge will contribute to updating the recommendations of the fifth edition of the ECAC.']",public,['23:23'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0033-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Feliu, Ariadna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFycmVyYSwgQmliaWFuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Barrera, Bibiana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHJ1cnksIEFtYW5kYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Drury, Amanda'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-5287', 'prefLabel': 'Hancean, Marian-Gabriel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VhbnTEgywgTWFyaXVz', 'prefLabel': 'Geantă, Marius'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29jemtvZGFqLCBQYXdlxYI=', 'prefLabel': 'Koczkodaj, Paweł'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGludG8sIFBhdHJpY2lh', 'prefLabel': 'Pinto, Patricia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGxhLCBNYXJnYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Pla, Marga'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGNoYWxha292LCBJdmFu', 'prefLabel': 'Tchalakov, Ivan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VnXEjWtvdmnEhywgSGVsZW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Vučković, Helena'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-242X', 'prefLabel': 'Zeeb, Hajo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-4687', 'prefLabel': 'Espina, Carolina'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Perceptions Towards the Adoption of Multi-Risk Factors Cancer Prevention Educational Tool Among European Union Citizens: A Multi-Country Qualitative Study Protocol'],2025-03-07T11:17:50.193+0100,266.0
frl:6489581,"['An interesting recent development in emotion research and clinical psychology is the discovery that affective states can be modeled as a network of temporally interacting moods or emotions. Additionally, external factors like stressors or treatments can influence the mood network by amplifying or dampening the activation of specific moods. Researchers have turned to multilevel autoregressive models to fit these affective networks using intensive longitudinal data gathered through ecological momentary assessment. Nonetheless, a more comprehensive examination of the performance of such models is warranted. In our study, we focus on simple directed intraindividual networks consisting of two interconnected mood nodes that mutually enhance or dampen each other. We also introduce a node representing external factors that affect both mood nodes unidirectionally. Importantly, we disregard the potential effects of a current mood/emotion on the perception of external factors. We then formalize the mathematical representation of such networks by exogenous linear autoregressive mixed-effects models. In this representation, the autoregressive coefficients signify the interactions between moods, while external factors are incorporated as exogenous covariates. We let the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in the model have fixed and random components. Depending on the analysis, this leads to networks with variable structures over reasonable time units, such as days or weeks, which are captured by the variability of random effects. Furthermore, the fixed-effects parameters encapsulate a subject-specific network structure. Leveraging the well-established theoretical and computational foundation of linear mixed-effects models, we transform the autoregressive formulation to a classical one and utilize the existing methods and tools. To validate our approach, we perform simulations assuming our model as the true data-generating process. By manipulating a predefined set of parameters, we investigate the reliability and feasibility of our approach across varying numbers of observations, levels of noise intensity, compliance rates, and scalability to higher dimensions. Our findings underscore the challenges associated with estimating individualized parameters in the context of common longitudinal designs, where the required number of observations may often be unattainable. Moreover, our study highlights the sensitivity of autoregressive mixed-effect models to noise levels and the difficulty of scaling due to the substantial number of parameters.']",public,['15:1213863'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG9vc2VoLCBTaGFrb29yIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Pooseh, Shakoor '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FsaXNjaCwgUmFmZmFlbCA=', 'prefLabel': 'Kalisch, Raffael '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S8O2YmVyLCBHw7ZyYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Köber, Göran'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmluZGVyLCBIYXJhbGQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Binder, Harald'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGltbWVyLCBKZW5z', 'prefLabel': 'Timmer, Jens'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Intraindividual time-varying dynamic network of affects: linear autoregressive mixed-effects models for ecological momentary assessment'],2025-01-29T08:12:47.681+0100,336.0
frl:6489579,"['The endocannabinoid system comprises highly versatile signaling functions within the nervous system. It is reported to modulate the release of several neurotransmitters, consequently affecting the activity of neuronal circuits. Investigations have highlighted its roles in numerous processes, including appetite-stimulating characteristics, particularly for palatable food. Moreover, endocannabinoids are shown to fine-tune dopamine-signaled processes governing motivated behavior. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that excitatory and inhibitory inputs controlled by the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) regulate dopaminergic neurons in the mesocorticolimbic pathway. In the present study, we show that mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) express CB1, and we investigated the consequences of specific deletion of CB1 in cells expressing the transcription factor Engrailed-1 (En1). To this end, we validated a new genetic mouse line EN1-CB1-KO, which displays a CB1 knockout in mesDA neurons beginning from their differentiation, as a tool to elucidate the functional contribution of CB1 in mesDA neurons. We revealed that EN1-CB1-KO mice display a significantly increased immobility time and shortened latency to the first immobility in the forced swim test of adult mice. Moreover, the maximal effort exerted to obtain access to chocolate-flavored pellets was significantly reduced under a progressive ratio schedule. In contrast, these mice do not differ in motor skills, anhedonia- or anxiety-like behavior compared to wild-type littermates. Taken together, these findings suggest a depressive-like or despair behavior in an inevitable situation and a lack of motivation to seek palatable food in EN1-CB1-KO mice, leading us to propose that CB1 plays an important role in the physiological functions of mesDA neurons. In particular, our data suggest that CB1 directly modifies the mesocorticolimbic pathway implicated in depressive-like/despair behavior and motivation. In contrast, the nigrostriatal pathway controlling voluntary movement seems to be unaffected.']",public,['17:1379889'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFkZGVuaGF1c2VuLCBTYXJhaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Baddenhausen, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THV0eiwgQmVhdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Lutz, Beat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mbWFubiwgQ2xlbWVudGluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hofmann, Clementine'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Cannabinoid type-1 receptor signaling in dopaminergic Engrailed-1 expressing neurons modulates motivation and depressive-like behavior'],2025-01-29T08:12:22.657+0100,336.0

The study included studying the chemical content and minerals of the M.\u2009oleifera leaves, preparation of aqueous and alcoholic extracts using an ultrasound device, then exploring the extraction yield. The results proved that the extraction yield by ultrasound using ethanol at 80% was the highest, reaching 19.22%. The total phenols in the ultrasonic extract with moringa leaves aqueous extract (AMEUS) amounted to 120,755\u2009mg/mL. Since the AMEUS exhibited the highest value of 68.308\u2009mg/mL calic acid – eight phenolic compounds discovered by HPLC – the total content of flavonoids was also calculated. The inhibitory and antioxidant effects of moringa leaf extracts are well documented. We monitored the changes in chemical indicators, such as the value of peroxide and thiobarbituric acid, as well as the percentage of free fatty acids and physical characteristics, such as water-carrying capacity, pH, and pigments, for storage periods 0, 4, 8, and 12\u2009days after adding AMEUS to beef patties at a concentration of 0.5%. The patties were kept under refrigeration at 4\u2009±\u20091°C during this time. The values of peroxide number, thiobarbituric acid, free fatty acid, and metmyoglobin pigment were decreased in the beef patties treated with the AMEUS. However, they increased continuously during the cryopreservation period, and there was a significant increase in water-holding capacity (WHC) when the beef patties were treated with AMEUS.

The inclusion of beans, along with HMT, altered the granular morphology, adhesive qualities, thermal characteristics, crystallinity, and protein secondary structure of the blended powders compared to GRF. Notably, the starch granules in the glutinous rice flour with red adzuki bean (R-GRF) were more complete in morphology, compact in structure, and exhibited higher heat stabilization and crystallinity, with significant changes in protein secondary structure. These modifications resulted in a low expected glycemic index (eGI) value of 52.01. Additionally, the quality assessment of the fast-frozen sweet dumplings showed that those made with red adzuki bean mixed with glutinous rice flour (R-SD) had superior texture, reduced cracking, and less water loss compared to those made with GRF (G-SD), while maintaining similar color and odor to G-SD.

The results demonstrated that adding RB considerably boosted extraction yields (p\u2009<\u2009.05), with 5% RB constituting the ideal combination. Adding 7.5% and 10% RB to the SS reduced free fatty acid (FFA) levels compared to the control sample. The oxidative stability index (OSI) and peroxide value (PV), however, significantly increased at combination ratios ranging from 2.5% to 10% (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Rice bran oil (TRBO) had the greatest OSI of all the studied oils, with 18.99\u2009h, while the extracted oils showed an increase in OSI as RB contents rose. Total phenolic compounds (TPC), tocopherols, γ-oryzanol content, and total antioxidant activity (TAA) increased directly with the RB level. Despite the addition of RB altering the fatty acids concentration, linoleic and oleic acids continued to be the predominant fatty acids in TSSO, TRBO, and other extracted oil samples. Increasing the combination ratio increased the palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic acid content and decreased the stearic and linoleic acid content.

Despite the presence of competing theoretical models, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of motivated reasoning remain elusive as previous empirical work did not properly track the belief formation process. To address this problem, we employed a design that identifies motivated reasoning as directional deviations from a Bayesian benchmark of unbiased belief updating. We asked the members of a proimmigration or an anti-immigration group regarding the extent to which they endorse factual messages on foreign criminality, a polarizing political topic. Both groups exhibited a desirability bias by overendorsing attitude-consistent messages and underendorsing attitude-discrepant messages and an identity bias by overendorsing messages from in-group members and underendorsing messages from out-group members. In both groups, neural responses to the messages predicted subsequent expression of desirability and identity biases, suggesting a common neural basis of motivated reasoning across ideologically opposing groups. Specifically, brain regions implicated in encoding value, error detection, and mentalizing tracked the degree of desirability bias. Less extensive activation in the mentalizing network tracked the degree of identity bias. These findings illustrate the distinct neurocognitive architecture of desirability and identity biases and inform existing cognitive models of politically motivated reasoning.']",public,['19(1):nsae056'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5212-1646', 'prefLabel': 'Lois, Giannis '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHNha2FzLCBFbGlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Tsakas, Elias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVlbiwgS2VubmV0aA==', 'prefLabel': 'Yuen, Kenneth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmllZGwsIEFybm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Riedl, Arno'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Tracking politically motivated reasoning in the brain: the role of mentalizing, value-encoding, and error detection networks']",2025-01-29T08:16:11.272+0100,336.0

However, caloric restriction is typically imposed simultaneously. Since caloric restriction is a stressor in its own right, this procedure interferes with data interpretation. Here, we investigate whether chronic social defeat stress (CSD), lasting 10 consecutive days, would alter effort-based reward motivation in mice trained under ad libitum food conditions. Utilizing operant FED3 boxes in home cages, mice were trained within eight days to nose poke for palatable food. After training completion, operant memory was retained for at least 16 days, and mice demonstrated sustained effort, as assessed with a progressive ratio schedule, to obtain reward pellets. Directly after CSD exposure (10th day), mice exhibited reduced effort for palatable food rewards, but also displayed reduced nose poking in general. The effects of CSD on effort were short-lived, with no lasting impact on effort-based reward motivation one week post-stress. As corticosterone (CORT) levels were increased at day 10 of CSD, but not at day 17, we hypothesized that CORT might mediate the acute effects of CSD on effort-based reward motivation. Indeed, CORT administration [100 μg/ml], supplied via the drinking water, mirrored the CSD-induced CORT spike and temporarily reduced reward motivation. Our findings emphasize that CSD does not result in long-term deficits in reward motivation, suggesting a resilient adaptive response in mice under unrestricted feeding conditions. This study underscores the necessity of considering temporal dynamics of stress impacts and highlights the modulating effects of CORT. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the resilience mechanisms in motivational impairments and pave the way for further research into factors facilitating this resilience.']",public,['33:100690'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXZlcnRzZSwgRGFuaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Evertse, Danina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWx2ZXMtTWFydGluZXosIFBpbGFy', 'prefLabel': 'Alves-Martinez, Pilar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHJlY2NhbmksIEdpdWxpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Treccani, Giulia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcO8bGxlciwgTWFyaWFubmUgQi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Müller, Marianne B.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWV5ZSwgRnJhbmsgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Meye, Frank J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFuIGRlciBLb29paiwgTWljaGFlbCBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Van der Kooij, Michael A.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Transient impact of chronic social stress on effort-based reward motivation in non-food restricted mice: Involvement of corticosterone'],2025-01-29T08:19:11.030+0100,336.0

Eligible studies examined the predictive value of resilience factors in stressor-exposed populations in high-income countries by means of multinomial regression models based on growth mixture modeling. Five databases were searched until August 2, 2023. Data synthesis employed a rating scheme to assess the incremental predictive value of resilience factors beyond sociodemographic variables and other resilience factors. An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk of bias assessment. Fifty studies (sample sizes: 360–65,818 participants) with moderate study quality reported on various stressors (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks). Higher income, socioeconomic status and perceived social support, better emotion regulation and psychological flexibility were related to more resilient responses. The association between resilience factors and resilient responses was stronger in samples with younger mean age and a larger proportion of women. Most studies used non-representative convenience samples and effects were smaller when accounting for sociodemographic variables and other resilience factors. For many factors, findings were mixed, supporting the importance of the fit between resilience factors and situational demands.

Given the increasing interest in functional foods, this study investigated the incorporation of nanocapsules containing curcumin (CLN) into functional stirred yogurt (CLN-Y). CLN was prepared with Persian gum (PG) at different levels and included in the yogurt formula (CLN-Y1%, CLN-Y2%, and CLN-Y3%). The physicochemical properties, rheological characteristics, antioxidant activity (AA), survival of starter bacteria, and sensory properties of the yogurt were evaluated over a 21-day storage period at 4°C. The results showed that CLN significantly improved AA (reduction of 7.31% in the control vs. 1.85% in CLN-Y3%), viscosity, hardness, and water holding capacity (reduction of 2.27% in control vs. 1.14% in CLN-Y3%), while reducing syneresis (an increase of 10.87% in control vs. 3.16% in CLN-Y3%) during storage (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CLN concentration directly affected AA. Although CLN-Y exhibited a yellowish color and lower light intensity than the control, the samples were well accepted during storage. Increasing CLN levels led to decreased taste, color, and overall acceptance scores, and a 3% concentration is recommended for yogurt formulation due to its potential to improve yogurt quality, provide antioxidant benefits, maintain probiotic viability, and achieve high consumer acceptance during storage.']",public,['12(11):9379-9390'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFnaGFkb3NpLCBNYXppYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Taghadosi, Maziar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6814-230X', 'prefLabel': 'Bolandi, Marzieh'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-3201-8848', 'prefLabel': 'Baghaei, Homa'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Encapsulation of Curcumin With Persian Gum and Its Application to the Production of Functional Yogurt: Physicochemical, Antioxidant, Sensory Properties, and Starter Bacteria Survival Study']",2025-05-05T12:35:58.227+0200,286.0

Women, who comprise 43% of the agricultural labor force, are particularly vulnerable due to gender inequalities, especially in African societies. While Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) offers potential benefits to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, its benefits are not evenly distributed, with a notable gender gap in adoption.\r\n\r\nMethods: This study investigates how gender dynamics influence CSA adoption patterns in Tanzania’s semi-arid Dodoma regions, using a mixed-methods approach. The study included a survey of 380 households and focus group discussions with 75 participants.\r\n\r\nResults: The results reveal lower CSA adoption among female-headed households (51% non-adopters) compared to male-headed households (38% non-adopters). Probit and Poisson regression analyses identify several key determinants of adoption and adoption intensity, including marital status, livestock ownership, land access, and the availability of extension services. Female-headed households face unique barriers, such as smaller landholdings, labor constraints, and limited access to credit, training, and group membership. The study also highlights the absence of female extension workers in villages.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The findings emphasize the need for targeted policy interventions to address these challenges and promote more equitable CSA adoption. These include implementing land reforms to ensure equitable land access for women, designing inclusive training programs that accommodate women’s time constraints, and increasing the representation of female extension workers to enhance CSA knowledge dissemination among female farmers. Additionally, improving access to credit facilities for female farmers, strengthening social networks through farmer groups, and improving transport infrastructure to reduce logistical barriers are crucial to further supporting CSA adoption. These targeted interventions are essential for overcoming gender-specific barriers, ensuring that CSA benefits are more equitably distributed, and ultimately supporting sustainable agricultural development.']",public,['8:1507540'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXdva2UsIE1haGxldCBEZWdlZnU=', 'prefLabel': 'Awoke, Mahlet Degefu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO2aHIsIEthdGhhcmluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Löhr, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2ltYXJvLCBBbnRob255IEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Kimaro, Anthony A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuYSwgTWFyY29z', 'prefLabel': 'Lana, Marcos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29oIFdlbmRhLCBCb3JpcyBELg==', 'prefLabel': 'Soh Wenda, Boris D.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVhYmVuZywgS3dhYmVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Buabeng, Kwabena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFmbmVyLCBKb2hhbm5lcyBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Hafner, Johannes Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYmVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Exploring gender dynamics in climate-smart agriculture adoption: a study in semi-arid Dodoma, Tanzania']",2025-06-03T10:34:11.063+0200,333.0

As a result, climate change, soil and land degradation, and biodiversity loss have been exacerbated. A potential solution for addressing these challenges and enhancing farm sustainability is diversification, such as implementing agroforestry systems. Specific indicators are commonly used to evaluate the potential of diversification practices. However, agreement on a common set of assessment indicators is rarely reached. Moreover, the different biophysical and socio-economic conditions between regions make it difficult to adopt practices based on standardized assessments. This study aims at developing a practical methodology to assess the sustainability of Mediterranean agroforestry systems, using a three-dimensional evaluation concept for agro-environmental, economic and social performances. The steps in this study were, (i) define a set of relevant indicators and selection criteria, (ii) validate and select indicators through a participatory approach and (iii) apply the indicators to assess the performance of olive-wild asparagus agroforestry systems in central Italy. Expert opinions and stakeholders’ participation were found to play an important role in identifying relevant indicators for assessing farming systems. The results showed that intercropping wild asparagus within olive orchards provides agro-environmental benefits and economic profitability, but also causes a higher workload. With a land equivalent ratio above one, the agroforestry system is more productive and results in a 50% higher income than olive sole cropping. With similar management practices, both systems had a comparable energy use efficiency and pesticide load index value. However, the annual workload, during the full production phase, increases by 75% in the agroforestry system mainly due to manual labor required for asparagus harvest. Furthermore, the agroforestry system had better economic resilience (positive net present value) in the face of drops in crop prices and rising production costs by up to 15%, whereas olive sole cropping generated negative net present value if costs increased by 10% or prices fell by 5%.']",public,['152:127012'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmV6Z3VpLCBGZXJkYW91cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Rezgui, Ferdaous'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9zYXRpLCBBZG9sZm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Rosati, Adolfo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFtYmFycmFhLUxlaG5oYXJkdCwgRmF0aW1h', 'prefLabel': 'Lambarraa-Lehnhardt, Fatima'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGF1bCwgQ2Fyc3Rlbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Paul, Carsten'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVja2xpbmcsIE1vcml0eg==', 'prefLabel': 'Reckling, Moritz'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Assessing Mediterranean agroforestry systems: Agro-economic impacts of olive wild asparagus in central Italy'],2025-05-14T15:55:30.190+0200,333.0
frl:6511187,"[""Dominant agri-food systems are increasingly seen as unsustainable in terms of environmental degradation, mass production or high food waste. In an attempt to counteract these developments and foster sustainability transitions in agri-food systems, a variety of actors are engaging in socially innovative models of food production and consumption. Using a multiple case study approach, our study examines three contrasting alternative economic models in the city of Berlin: community gardens, the app Too Good To Go (TGTG), and a cooperative supermarket. Based on 15 qualitative interviews, we provide insights into their transformative potential by exploring participants' underlying motivations, the changes they have experienced, and the challenges and potential for future development of these models. We find that participation in community gardens and the cooperative supermarket is similarly motivated by social aspects and dissatisfaction with existing food access options, while TGTG users are more motivated by financial reasons. Our study shows that change is experienced mainly at the individual level, e.g. by building new relationships, changing cognitive framings, and learning (new) practices, especially in community-oriented settings. The individualization of change shows that these models have a rather low potential to lead to more systemic accounts of changes. Yet, they can prefigure regime change, describe resistance, and foster cumulative incremental change that may spill over into society. We conclude that in order to sustain this role and drive transitions, it is important to up- and outscale these models; and we provide recommendations on how these models can mutually support their development, establishment, and protection.""]",public,['41(4):1481-1502'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2168-1047', 'prefLabel': 'Zoll, Felix'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFyZGVyLCBBbGV4YW5kcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Harder, Alexandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuYXRzYSwgTGVyYXRvIE55YXJhZHpv', 'prefLabel': 'Manatsa, Lerato Nyaradzo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2340-6719', 'prefLabel': 'Friedrich, Jonathan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Motivations, changes and challenges of participating in food-related social innovations and their transformative potential: three cases from Berlin (Germany)']",2025-05-06T10:35:44.239+0200,333.0

Our results show that the area under rubber plantations has increased significantly within the study area, with the area under rubber plantations increasing from 30 to 74% of the total area within five decades. Impact assessment of land use changes based on household surveys showed significant improvement in the socio-economic conditions of the farmers, however, at the expense of severe environmental degradation. Our results also indicate that while areas under rubber plantations continue to increase, the drivers of land use changes have changed over time. Furthermore, it has been observed that in the past, many interventions prioritized social and economic development and placed less emphasis on the ecological stability of the region. Perceptions of farmers revealed that the effects of ecological fragility already affected the economic robustness of the whole area. Therefore, we conclude that government interventions to support additional rubber cultivation should also focus on ecosystem stabilization in order to minimize the risk of an ecological catastrophe that would significantly affect the economic prosperity of the region.']",public,['196(4):356'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlqYXlhbiwgRGhhbnlh', 'prefLabel': 'Vijayan, Dhanya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2lyaW5kcmFuLCBSZW5veQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Girindran, Renoy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FtLCBBbnUgU3VzYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sam, Anu Susan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2F0aHlhbiwgQXJjaGFuYSBSYWdoYXZhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Sathyan, Archana Raghavan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S8OkY2hlbGUsIEhhcmFsZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Kächele, Harald'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The large-scale expansion of rubber plantations in southern India: major impacts and the changing nature of drivers'],2025-02-03T10:18:10.733+0100,333.0

Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non-vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its ‘Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles’, which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs.

Since investigating these processes in vivo is both technically challenging and ethically sensitive, cell culture models have been established to reproduce the oviductal microenvironment. Compartmentalized culture systems, particularly air–liquid interface cultures (ALI; cells access the culture medium only from the basolateral cell side), result in highly differentiated oviduct epithelial cell cultures. The oxygen (O2) tension within the oviduct is 4–10% across species, and its reduced O2 content is presumed to be important for early reproductive processes. However, cell culture models of the oviduct are typically cultivated without O2 regulation and therefore at about 18% O2. To investigate the impact of O2 levels on oviduct epithelium functions in vitro, we cultured porcine oviduct epithelial cells (POEC) at the ALI using both physiological (5%) and supraphysiological (18%) O2 levels and two different media regimes. Epithelium architecture, barrier function, secretion of oviduct fluid surrogate (OFS), and marker gene expression were comparatively assessed. Under all culture conditions, ALI-POEC formed polarized, ciliated monolayers with appropriate barrier function. Exposure to 18% O2 accelerated epithelial differentiation and significantly increased the apical OFS volume and total protein content. Expression of oviduct genes and the abundance of OVGP1 (oviduct-specific glycoprotein 1) in the OFS were influenced by both O2 tension and medium choice. In conclusion, oviduct epithelial cells can adapt to a supraphysiological O2 environment. This adaptation, however, may alter their capability to replicate in vivo tissue characteristics.']",public,['161(6):521-537'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVvLCBKaWFuY2hhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Huo, Jianchao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcOzd2nFhHNrYSwgQWxla3NhbmRyYSBNYXJpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mówińska, Aleksandra Maria'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXJlbiwgQWxpIE5lY21p', 'prefLabel': 'Eren, Ali Necmi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5790-3217', 'prefLabel': 'Schoen, Jennifer'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0139-5545', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Shuai'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Oxygen levels affect oviduct epithelium functions in air–liquid interface culture'],2025-06-12T07:26:13.630+0200,336.0
frl:6511769,"[""Habitat loss and degradation are key drivers of the current biodiversity crisis. Most research focuses on the question of which traits allow species to persist in degraded habitats. We asked whether a species' trophic position or niche width influences the resilience of species in degraded habitats and to what extent habitat degradation affects trophic interactions between species. We used nitrogen isotope ratios (15N:14N, expressed as δ15N value) to quantify and compare trophic positions and niche widths of understory birds inhabiting old-growth and young secondary forests in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica. We found that a species' trophic position rather than its trophic niche width determined its persistence in secondary forests. Species feeding at lower trophic levels in old-growth forests were less likely to persist in secondary forests than those occupying a higher trophic position in old-growth forests. This pattern is likely induced by the occurrence of relatively large-bodied habitat specialists with a flexible and high-trophic level diet in secondary forests. These habitat specialists likely caused generalist bird species to lower their trophic position relative to conspecifics in old-growth forests. Regarding trophic niche widths, species in secondary forests tend to have larger niche widths than old-growth forest species. However, as old-growth forest specialists and generalists did not differ in their niche widths, no systematic effect of trophic niche width on species persistence after forest disturbance was found. This is the first study that shows a systematic effect of trophic position on the persistence of a wide range of bird species in a disturbed forest ecosystem. It therefore provides important insights into species' responses to habitat degradation and the conservation value of secondary forests. To improve habitat quality for old-growth forest birds and facilitate avian seed dispersal, the creation of large contiguous forest patches should be prioritised when implementing reforestation measures.""]",public,['14(5):e11370'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-4285-8101', 'prefLabel': 'Paces, Bernhard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZWssIFdvbGZnYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Wanek, Wolfgang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9pZ3QsIENocmlzdGlhbiBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoaXJtZXIsIFNhc2tpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Schirmer, Saskia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVpZGluZ2VyLCBQYXVsdXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Leidinger, Paulus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6ZSwgQ2hyaXN0aWFuIEgu', 'prefLabel': 'Schulze, Christian H.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Trophic position determines the persistence of neotropical understory birds after forest disturbance'],2025-06-12T07:39:39.916+0200,336.0

frl:6511740,"['Throughout the last decades, the emergence of zoonotic diseases and the frequency of disease outbreaks have increased substantially, fuelled by habitat encroachment and vectors overlapping with more hosts due to global change. The virulence of pathogens is one key trait for successful invasion. In order to understand how global change drivers such as habitat homogenization and climate change drive pathogen virulence evolution, we adapted an established individual-based model of host–pathogen dynamics. Our model simulates a population of social hosts affected by a directly transmitted evolving pathogen in a dynamic landscape. Pathogen virulence evolution results in multiple strains in the model that differ in their transmission capability and lethality. We represent the effects of global change by simulating environmental changes both in time (resource asynchrony) and space (homogenization). We found an increase in pathogenic virulence and a shift in strain dominance with increasing landscape homogenization. Our model further indicated that lower virulence is dominant in fragmented landscapes, although pulses of highly virulent strains emerged under resource asynchrony. While all landscape scenarios favoured co-occurrence of low- and high-virulent strains, the high-virulence strains capitalized on the possibility for transmission when host density increased and were likely to become dominant. With asynchrony likely to occur more often due to global change, our model showed that a subsequent evolution towards lower virulence could lead to some diseases becoming endemic in their host populations.']",public,['14(2):e11065'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4587-9894', 'prefLabel': 'Kürschner, Tobias'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0465-2543', 'prefLabel': 'Scherer, Cédric'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3072-0095', 'prefLabel': 'Radchuk, Viktoriia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmxhdW0sIE5pZWxz', 'prefLabel': 'Blaum, Niels'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVy4oCQU2NoYWR0LCBTdGVwaGFuaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer‐Schadt, Stephanie'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Resource asynchrony and landscape homogenization as drivers of virulence evolution: The case of a directly transmitted disease in a social host'],2025-06-12T07:28:33.564+0200,336.0

As urban areas expand, attic-dwelling bats face the problem of being exposed to more and more artificial light as they move to their dark foraging areas. Avoiding street lights could force bats to make energetically costly detours, which could eventually lead to the collapse of urban colonies. We therefore investigated the response of attic-dwelling bats to street lighting, using the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) as an example. Using radio-tracking, we followed 17 bats during their commutes through two urban areas: a small town and a village in rural Germany. After a conservative filtering process to ensure a high spatial accuracy of the tracking data, we analysed the data of nine bats in detail, using a use-versus-availability approach for the small town and a descriptive approach for the smaller dataset obtained from the village. The best-fitting model confirmed that the bats responded to artificial light at night. Close to the roost (∼10 m), bats preferred areas with low light intensities, but seemed to tolerate some light levels. We speculate that this pattern was caused by bats being forced to leave the roost into an illuminated area. At medium distances from roosts (∼400 m), most bats avoided street lights. In fact, all bats avoided being in close proximity to street lights, even when the lanterns produced only low levels of light. We conclude that brown long-eared bats avoid street lights when moving through urban areas. We recommend the establishment of dark corridors in urban areas to support high bat diversity, including all species along the continuum of light-opportunistic and light-sensitive species.']",public,['54:e03112'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmV1c2NoLCBDaHJpc3RpbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Reusch, Christine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmluZGFzLVBpY2FkbywgSm9zw6kgQmVybmFyZG8=', 'prefLabel': 'Vindas-Picado, José Bernardo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Nob2x6LCBDYXJvbGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Scholz, Carolin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mZm1laXN0ZXIsIFV3ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffmeister, Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9pZ3QsIENocmlzdGlhbiBDLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Voigt, Christian C.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Light-averse behaviour of attic-dwelling bats when commuting through urban areas'],2025-06-12T07:43:26.818+0200,336.0

As the flood pulse in the Tonlé Sap floodplain recedes post-monsoon, leaving rice fields and local water bodies dry, Community Fish Refuges (CFRs) offer a promising path to sustain dry season fish stocks, aquatic biodiversity, and secure water for agriculture and husbandry. Their sustained physical integrity and productivity as multiple-use systems hinge on communities’ ability to manage these systems collectively. To explore whether the studied communities have been able to respond to the challenge of collectively governing CFR, we investigate two CFR sites that were established in 2016 by local and international organizations alongside State authorities. Our aim is to investigate two key aspects: 1) the presence, extent, and efficacy of community-level collective action (CA) for managing CFRs; and 2) the factors that either facilitate or inhibit CA regarding CFRs. We conducted a qualitative case study between March and May 2023 at two sites in Kampong Thom Province. These were selected because while they have similar ecological features, they show different management results according to the implementing international organization WorldFish. This paper delves into a process guided by external agents seeking to reshape local behavior and existing institutional frameworks. Results show how centralized power structures and entrenched rural patronage politics in villages limit villagers’ participation and agency in CFRs management. Villagers encounter constraints hindering their capacity to instigate change, prompting a re-evaluation of the CFR Committee’s composition and operation to ensure broader legitimacy among actors. While emphasizing extended project funding and informed external intervention strategies, the study underscores doubts about short-term CA feasibility. It highlights the critical influence of contextual factors and policymakers’ assumptions in achieving effective collective governance.

The productivity of mushrooms cultivated using fresh and dried brewer’s spent grains did not exhibit a statistically significant difference, indicating that this residue can be utilized shortly after its generation in the industrial process, thereby reducing costs associated with production. Combining brewer’s spent grains with banana or peach palm leaves resulted in enhanced mushroom production (0.41 and 0.38 g day−1, respectively) compared to using the leaves as a sole substrate. The mushrooms produced contain sugars and a minimal sodium content, and are considered a source of phosphorus. In addition, no toxic elements (Hg and Pb) were present. The mycelium-based composites produced using the residual substrate (after the mushroom harvest) exhibited better mechanical properties (compressive strength\u2009=\u20090.04 MPa, density\u2009=\u2009242 kg m−3, and low humidity sorption) than those produced using fresh substrate. The results demonstrate the synergistic effect of combining the two approaches under investigation. The use of brewer´s spent enhance the mushroom productivity and the residual substrate enhance the mechanical properties of mycelium-based composites. The compressive strength, density, and air humidity sorption properties are essential for determining the potential applications of mycelium-based composites. The use of brewer’s spent grains mixed with banana leaves demonstrated significant promise for mushroom production and subsequent application in the development of mycelium-based composites. These sequential approaches contribute to waste valorization and the rational utilization of natural resources, as the mycelium-based composites are considered for substitution of synthetic materials, thereby promoting sustainability for future generations.']",public,['14(1):26281'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZG8gTmFzY2ltZW50byBEZXNjaGFtcHMsIEpvYXJhIEzDumNpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'do Nascimento Deschamps, Joara Lúcia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6LCBKb8OjbyBHdWlsaGVybWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Schulz, João Guilherme'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29zdGEgUmlhbmksIEpvc2lhbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Costa Riani, Josiane'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9uYXR0aS1DaGF2ZXMsIE1hcmlhbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bonatti-Chaves, Mariane'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9uYXR0aSwgTWljaGVsbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bonatti, Michelle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYmVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuYSwgTWFyY29z', 'prefLabel': 'Lana, Marcos'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lzYmVjaywgRWxpc2FiZXRo', 'prefLabel': 'Wisbeck, Elisabeth'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Sustainable production of Pleurotus sajor-caju mushrooms and biocomposites using brewer’s spent and agro-industrial residues'],2025-05-19T10:34:13.867+0200,333.0

Due to their shallow groundwater table, wet grasslands promote a strong interconnection between diverse vegetation and soil water. Researchers have investigated how wet grasslands respond to environmental changes, using various simulation models to understand how these sites contribute to water, C and N dynamics. However, a comprehensive, simultaneous study of all three of these dynamics is still lacking. This study makes use of a grassland lysimeter study with differently managed groundwater levels and employs the process-based MOdel for NItrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agroecosystems (MONICA) to simulate these dynamics. By using SPOTPY (Statistical Parameter Optimization Tool) to optimise the relevant parameters, we find that MONICA performs well in simulating vegetation growth (aboveground biomass), and elements of the water (evapotranspiration), C (gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration) and N (N in aboveground biomass, nitrate in soil solution, Nitrous oxide emissions) balance, with Willmott's Refined Index of Agreement always larger than 0.35. This level of accuracy demonstrates that MONICA is ready to be applied for scenario simulations of groundwater management and climate change to evaluate their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and long-term carbon storage, as well as water and nitrogen losses in wet grasslands.""]",public,['949:174995'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbGVkaSwgVmFsZWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Khaledi, Valeh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFhdHosIFJvbGFuZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Baatz, Roland'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW50b25pamV2acSHLCBEYW5pY2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Antonijević, Danica'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mZm1hbm4sIE1hdGhpYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffmann, Mathias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGlldHJpY2gsIE90dGZyaWVk', 'prefLabel': 'Dietrich, Ottfried'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzY2hlaWQsIEd1bm5hcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lischeid, Gunnar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGF2aWVzLCBNYXJpZWwgRi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Davies, Mariel F.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVyeiwgQ2hyaXN0b3Bo', 'prefLabel': 'Merz, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmVuZGVsLCBDbGFhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Nendel, Claas'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","[""Evaluating MONICA's capability to simulate water, carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a wet grassland at contrasting water tables""]",2025-05-15T10:24:28.419+0200,333.0

Amorphous species exhibit faster weathering and generally possess a larger specific surface area in comparison to crystalline species. However, the characterization of these different species is commonly based on wet chemical extraction methods, which lack selectivity. While Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in the mid-infrared range can differentiate between short-range ordered aluminosilicates (SROAS) and pure amorphous silica (ASi), few systematic studies are found on the IR spectral features that distinguish solid Si species by crystallinity. This study aims to identify FTIR absorption bands that can differentiate Si species based on their crystallinity. Our data clearly indicate that ASi can be distinguished from very crystalline silica (quartz) and sea sand. The absorption band at approximately 800 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra allows determining the degree of crystallinity of the studied ASi species since the band becomes smaller and the band maximum shifted toward lower wavenumbers with increasing degree of crystallinity. Hence, FTIR spectra may be used to differentiate certain Si species in complex samples like soils, allowing the estimation of weatherability and surface reactivity of those species.']",public,['5:1462678'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxsZXJicm9jaywgUnV0aCBILg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ellerbrock, Ruth H.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RlaW4sIE1hdGhpYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Mathias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoYWxsZXIsIErDtnJnIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Schaller, Jörg '}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Comparing silicon mineral species of different crystallinity using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy'],2025-05-15T14:35:12.272+0200,333.0

However, frost risk is often overlooked in climate change studies, especially those that rely on process-based crop models. This study assesses the spring frost risk for winter wheat in South Korea using observed trial data, a process-based crop model, and a large ensemble of climate data. Trial data from seven sites across South Korea suggest that the extreme yield loss in the 2019/20 season resulted from a combination of a warm winter, which accelerated phenology, and a cool April, which led to several frost events around heading. Projections with a calibrated DSSAT-Nwheat model and a large ensemble of climate data (HAPPI) suggest that the risk of yield loss due to spring frost will increase in the southern region of South Korea. However, this risk can be reduced by switching to later-maturing cultivars to avoid spring frost. In contrast, while the risk of yield loss due to spring frost in the central and northern regions is not expected to increase significantly, it will persist and can only be reduced by introducing frost-tolerant cultivars. Extending this analysis to include losses from other major stressors and linking it to socio-economic analyses will be needed for developing long-term strategies to boost wheat production, enhance self-sufficiency, and ensure food security.']",public,['366:110484'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2ltLCBZZWFuLVVr', 'prefLabel': 'Kim, Yean-Uk'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXNzZW5nLCBTZW50aG9sZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Asseng, Senthold'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2ViYmVyLCBIZWlkaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Webber, Heidi'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Spring frost risk assessment on winter wheat in South Korea'],2025-05-21T14:50:27.917+0200,333.0

The magnitude of drift can be mitigated by maximising the effective population size, as is the goal of genetic management strategies. Different mating systems, specifically those leading to reproductive skew, exacerbate genetic drift by distorting contributions. In the absence of an active management strategy, reproductive skew will have long-term effects on the genetic composition of a population, particularly where admixture is present. Here we examine the contrasting effects of conservation management strategies in two ex situ populations of the Critically Endangered eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli), one managed as a semi-wild population in South Africa (SAx), and one managed under a mean-kinship breeding strategy in European zoos. We use molecular data to reconstruct pedigrees for both populations and validate the method using the zoo studbook. Using the reconstructed pedigree and studbook we show there is male sex-specific skew in both populations. However, the zoo’s mean-kinship breeding strategy effectively reduces reproductive skew in comparison to a semi-wild population with little genetic management. We also show that strong male reproductive skew in SAx has resulted in extensive admixture, which may require a re-evaluation of the population’s original intended role in the black rhino meta-population. With a high potential for admixture in many ex situ populations of endangered species, molecular and pedigree data remain vital tools for populations needing to balance drift and selection.']",public,['25(4):897-910'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8811-8198', 'prefLabel': 'Elsner-Gearing, Franziska'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JldHpzY2htYXIsIFBldHJh', 'prefLabel': 'Kretzschmar, Petra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2h1bHR6LCBTdXNhbm5l', 'prefLabel': 'Shultz, Susanne'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGlsZ3JpbSwgTWFyaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Pilgrim, Mark'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGF3c29uLCBEZWJvcmFoIEFubg==', 'prefLabel': 'Dawson, Deborah Ann'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9yc2J1cmdoLCBHYXZpbiBKb2hu', 'prefLabel': 'Horsburgh, Gavin John'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHJ1YnksIErDrXLDrQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hruby, Jírí'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9wcGVyLCBKYW5l', 'prefLabel': 'Hopper, Jane'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2luZywgVG9ueQ==', 'prefLabel': 'King, Tony'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FsdG9uLCBDYXRoZXJpbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Walton, Catherine'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Admixture and reproductive skew shape the conservation value of ex situ populations of the Critically Endangered eastern black rhino'],2025-06-12T07:22:20.294+0200,336.0

However, the stress induced by capture, handling, and tagging can impact post-release locomotion and activity and, consequently, the interpretation of study results. Here, we analyze post-tagging effects on 1585 individuals of 42 terrestrial mammal species using collar-collected GPS and accelerometer data. Species-specific displacements and overall dynamic body acceleration, as a proxy for activity, were assessed over 20\u2009days post-release to quantify disturbance intensity, recovery duration, and speed. Differences were evaluated, considering species-specific traits and the human footprint of the study region. Over 70% of the analyzed species exhibited significant behavioral changes following collaring events. Herbivores traveled farther with variable activity reactions, while omnivores and carnivores were initially less active and mobile. Recovery duration proved brief, with alterations diminishing within 4–7 tracking days for most species. Herbivores, particularly males, showed quicker displacement recovery (4\u2009days) but slower activity recovery (7\u2009days). Individuals in high human footprint areas displayed faster recovery, indicating adaptation to human disturbance.

Animals were divided into five groups: control, glycerol (received it for rhabdomyolysis induction), extract (received 12\u2009mg/kg C.\u2009botrys extract), and treatment groups with dexamethasone (0.03\u2009mg/kg) and extract (12\u2009mg/kg). The extract was analyzed using HNMR. After a week, blood and urine samples were taken to measure protein, urea, and creatinine. Then, the animals were sacrificed, and the kidney tissue was removed to examine the antioxidant, TNF-α, and histopathological evaluations. Also, NF-κB gene expression was investigated. The serum creatinine, TNF-α, and NF-κB ratio significantly increased and antioxidant capacity decreased in the glycerol group compared with the control. Pathological evaluation also showed severe renal damage based on the related criteria. In the treatment groups with dexamethasone and especially extract, the considered parameters attenuated relatively compared with the glycerol group. Kidney damage and functional impairment associated with rhabdomyolysis, as well as the inflammatory response caused by increased NF-κB and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, may be alleviated by C.\u2009botrys.

frl:6524995,"['Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive among the breast cancer subtypes and poses unique therapeutic challenges due to its distinct characteristics like lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC demonstrates poor survival rate enhanced immunogenic characteristics and a more favorable tumor microenvironment than other breast cancer variants. Also, TNBC patients show elevated levels of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in contrast to non-TNBC patients. Binding of PD-L1 with PD-1 produces an inhibitory signal, resulting in suppression of T-cell. Therapeutic approaches utilizing immunotherapies against PD-L1 exhibit promising outcomes in the treatment of TNBC. Limitations like suboptimal efficacy, inadequate oral bioavailability, and associated immune-related adverse effects of antibody-mediated anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have necessitated the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Thus, small molecules become an alternate option for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. In the present study, we have used virtual screening to identify potential phytochemicals from selected Indian medicinal plants as PD-L1 inhibitors. A total of 953 phytochemicals derived from eleven selected medicinal plants were initially screened through molecular docking using the PyRx tool. Among the 953 identified phytochemicals, the top 20 compounds exhibiting the highest binding affinities in docking study were selected for further analysis. Following comprehensive ADMET analyses, 2 compounds were ultimately identified as suitable candidates for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. The study identified 4-hydroxychalcone and flavylium from Glycyrrhiza glabra and Catharanthus roseus, respectively as potential PD-L1 inhibitors with enhanced stability relative to the reference molecule. Both compounds also showed enhanced gastrointestinal absorption with no predicted cytotoxic and immunotoxic effects. Consequently, these compounds present promising candidates for novel PD-L1 inhibitor development in TNBC therapy. Further experimental investigations are necessary to facilitate their clinical translation.']",public,['20(7):e0327475'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWhtZWQsIFNrLiBGYWlzYWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Ahmed, Sk.

PTMC refers to thyroid papillary carcinoma with a maximum diameter of ≤1\u2009cm.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThere were 186 patients (PTMC group) whose maximum tumor diameter was\u2009≤\u20091\u2009cm and 45 patients (PTC group) whose maximum tumor diameter was\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm. The patient’s age was (45.97\u2009±\u200910.63) years for the PTMC group and (45.31\u2009±\u200911.55) years for the PTC group. No statistically significant differences existed between the two groups in sex, age, BRAF V600E gene mutation, tumor multifocality, and capsular invasion (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Between the two groups, there were statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) differences in TNM staging, the thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) staging, and cervical lymph node metastasis.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThyroid surgery, thermal ablation, and active monitoring are different approaches in the stratified treatment of PTMC and PTC.

frl:6525037,"['Class Ι major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-Ι), encoded by the highly polymorphic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes in humans, are expressed on all nucleated cells. Both self and foreign proteins are processed to peptides of 8–10 amino acids, loaded into MHC-Ι, within the endoplasmic reticulum and then presented on the cell surface. Foreign peptides presented in this fashion activate CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and their immunogenicity correlates with their affinity for the MHC-Ι binding groove. Thus, predicting antigen binding affinity for MHC-Ι is a valuable tool for identifying potentially immunogenic antigens. While quite a few predictors for MHC-Ι binding exist, there are no currently available tools that can predict antigen/MHC-Ι binding affinity for antigens with explicitly labeled post-translational modifications or unusual/non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs). However, such modifications are increasingly recognized as critical mediators of peptide immunogenicity. In this work, we propose a machine learning application that quantifies the binding affinity of epitopes containing NCAAs to MHC-Ι and compares its performance with other commonly used regressors. Our model demonstrates robust performance, with 5-fold cross-validation yielding an R2 value of 0.477 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.735, indicating strong predictive capability for peptides with NCAAs. This work provides a valuable tool for the computational design and optimization of peptides incorporating NCAAs, potentially accelerating the development of novel peptide-based therapeutics with enhanced properties and efficacy.']",public,['20(6):e0314833'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4736-4680', 'prefLabel': 'Jiang, Shan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3UsIFpoYW9xaWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Su, Zhaoqian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qmxvb2R3b3J0aCwgTmF0aGFuaWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Bloodworth, Nathaniel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3982-1311', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Yunchao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFydGluYSwgQ3Jpc3RpbmEgRS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Martina, Cristina E.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFycmlzb24sIERhdmlkIEcu', 'prefLabel': 'Harrison, David G.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8945-193X', 'prefLabel': 'Meiler, Jens'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Machine learning application to predict binding affinity between peptide containing non-canonical amino acids and HLA-A0201'],2025-07-15T10:30:11.399+0200,355.0

The secondary aim of the study was to compare Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) with Nutritional Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002). Patients diagnosed with stroke, anoxic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, neuromuscular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and lymphedema who were admitted to a rehabilitation hospital were included. NRS-2002, MST, and MUST were used to assess malnutrition risk. Body weight (kg), height (cm), and mid upper arm circumference (cm) were measured. Twenty-four hours dietary records were obtained. Routine blood test results were recorded from patient files. Five hundred sixteen patients with a mean age of 54.3\u2009±\u200918.0\u2009years were included. The most prominent diagnoses were stroke and spinal cord injury. According to NRS-2002, 71.7% (n\u2009=\u2009370) of the patients were at low risk, but 28.3% (n\u2009=\u2009146) of the patients were at high risk. Comparisons between NRS-2002 and MST showed that these two scales have similar results at classifying patients for malnutrition risk (p\u2009=\u20090.154). Comparison between NRS-2002 and MUST showed significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Both sensitivity and specificity of MST were above 80.0%. Sensitivity of MUST was 78.1% and specificity was 88.1%. Approximately one-third of the patients were at risk of malnutrition.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common grade IV glioma, exhibits an extremely aggressive phenotype and a dismal five-year survival rate of only 6%, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in particular has attracted attention for its dual cytotoxic and immunostimulatory effects. In GBM models, PDT induces immunogenic cell death characterized by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which promote antigen presentation and activate T cell responses. Additionally, PDT transiently increases blood–brain barrier permeability, facilitating immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and enhances clearance of waste products via stimulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels. Importantly, PDT can reprogram or inactivate immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, thereby counteracting the pro-tumoral microenvironment. Despite these encouraging findings, further preclinical and clinical studies are required to elucidate PDT’s underlying immunological mechanisms fully and to optimize treatment regimens that maximize its efficacy as part of integrated immunotherapeutic strategies against GBM.']",public,['30(15):3091'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0001-6962-2655', 'prefLabel': 'Woźnicki, Paweł '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5557-5464', 'prefLabel': 'Bartusik-Aebisher, Dorota'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-3265-8990', 'prefLabel': 'Przygórzewska, Agnieszka'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2661-6570', 'prefLabel': 'Aebisher, David'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Immunological Insights into Photodynamic Therapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme'],2025-07-24T10:44:24.571+0200,355.0

We combined GPS tracking data of 19 individuals collected between 2012 and 2022 with food availability and spatial threat maps of both intentional (poachers directly targeting vultures) and unintentional (farmers aiming to kill carnivores, with vultures being secondarily affected) poisoning across most of Southern Africa. We identified poisoning hotspots in northern Botswana and south-eastern Namibia. These areas were also associated with a high number of vulture mortalities, providing additional support for poisoning risk. Northern Botswana and areas at the border between Botswana and South Africa were characterized by high food availability, potentially amplifying the mortality rate by attracting vultures from surrounding areas. Our results offer valuable insights for regional vulture conservation, together with a methodological framework for quantifying and mapping the spatial exposure to threats for mobile species of conservation concern, enabling improved targeting of conservation actions.']",public,['28(2):291-302'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9082-6433', 'prefLabel': 'Curk, Teja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVsemhlaW1lciwgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Melzheimer, J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXNjaGVuYm9ybiwgTy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Aschenborn, O.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1hciwgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Amar, A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29sYmVyZywgSC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Kolberg, H.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FyYmV0dCwgUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Garbett, R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF1ZGUsIEcu', 'prefLabel': 'Maude, G.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVhZGluZywgUi4gUC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Reading, R.

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with 28-day mortality in pediatric patients with candidemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 63 pediatric patients diagnosed with acute leukemia and candidemia following intensive chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and epidemiological data were collected. Antifungal susceptibility data were available for 60 patients. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the 28-day mortality rate, and Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 28-day mortality rate among the 63 patients (57.1% male, median age 9.74 years) was 36.5%. Candida tropicalis was the predominant species (96.8%). Antifungal susceptibility rates were 100% for amphotericin B and caspofungin and 22.2% for fluconazole. The factors independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality were an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 0.2 G/L at the time of candidemia diagnosis (5.3% vs. 50% mortality; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01–0.61), the use of antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) (26.3% vs. 52%; HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13–0.74), and granulocyte transfusion (GTX) combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (20% vs. 47.4%; HR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.85).

With the growth of public MRI repositories, access to data has finally become easier. However, filtering large datasets for potential poor-quality outliers can be a challenge. We present AIDAqc, a machine-learning-assisted automated Python-based command-line tool for small animal MRI quality assessment. Quality control features include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temporal SNR, and motion. All features are automatically calculated and no regions of interest are needed. Automated outlier detection for a given dataset combines the interquartile range and the machine-learning methods one-class support vector machine, isolation forest, local outlier factor, and elliptic envelope. To evaluate the reliability of individual quality control metrics, a simulation of noise (Gaussian, salt and pepper, speckle) and motion was performed. In outlier detection, single scans with induced artifacts were successfully identified by AIDAqc. AIDAqc was challenged in a large heterogeneous dataset collected from 19 international laboratories, including data from mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils, obtained with different hardware and at different field strengths. The results show that the manual inter-rater agreement (mean Fleiss Kappa score 0.17) is low when identifying poor-quality data. A direct comparison of AIDAqc results, therefore, showed only low-to-moderate concordance. In a manual post hoc validation of AIDAqc output, precision was high (>70%). The outlier data can have a significant impact on further postprocessing, as shown in representative functional and structural connectivity analysis.

Multiple induced pluripotent stem cell lines have been established, primordial germ cell–like cells have been generated, oocytes have been collected from the remaining females, blastocysts have been cryopreserved, and the closely related southern white rhinoceros (SWR) is being established as a surrogate. Recently, the first successful embryo transfer in SWR demonstrated that embryos can be generated by in vitro fertilization and cryopreserved. We explore progress to date in using advanced cellular technologies to save the NWR and highlight the necessary next steps to ensure a viable population for reintroduction.

Moreover, we evaluated the domestic cat (Felis catus) as a potential model species for male pangolin reproduction by comparing their testicular transcriptomes. We demonstrated a clear tissue-specific gene expression supporting the unique biological signature of each reproductive tissue and identified critical genes of the different reproductive organs. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed unique pathways in the testis as well as a clear epididymal transition. Furthermore, domestic cats, despite being the closest domestic species to pangolin, demonstrated their unfitness as a male reproduction model species as clear differences in spermatid differentiation and metabolism were observed.

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated people’s preferences for seeing wild mammals in residential areas by conducting and analyzing an online survey distributed across Germany (n = 2997 participants). Our results revealed that preferred species (squirrels, hedgehogs, hares, roe deer) were frequently encountered, whereas unpreferred species were those encountered frequently (rats, martens), as well as those encountered rarely (wild boar, coypus, raccoons). We also found a moderately positive correlation between the number of encounters with mammals and them being preferred by humans. Finally, some socio-demographic variables, particularly gender, garden access, and urbanity, are significantly related to human preferences. Based on our results, we propose tailoring wildlife management in residential areas to promote the positive attributes of preferred wildlife as biodiversity ambassadors, while also addressing ways to mitigate encounters and negative perceptions associated with unpreferred species.']",public,['29(3):6'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3186-9644', 'prefLabel': 'Moesch, Simon'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4118-4056', 'prefLabel': 'Straka, Tanja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3328-4217', 'prefLabel': 'Jeschke, Jonathan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4065-5194', 'prefLabel': 'Haase, Dagmar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9269-4446', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['The good, the bad, and the unseen: wild mammal encounters influence wildlife preferences of residents across socio-demographic gradients']",2025-06-12T07:35:21.021+0200,336.0
frl:6511776,"['Advances in tracking technologies have revealed the diverse migration patterns of birds, which are critical for range mapping and population estimation. Population trends are usually estimated in breeding ranges where birds remain stationary, but for species that breed in remote areas like the Arctic, these trends are often assessed in over-wintering ranges. Assessing population trends during the wintering season is challenging due to the extensive movements of birds in these ranges, which requires a deep understanding of the movement dynamics. However, these movements remain understudied, particularly in the mid-latitudes, where many Arctic breeders overwinter, increasing uncertainty in their ranges and numbers. Here, we show that the Arctic breeding raptor Rough-legged buzzard, which overwinters in the mid-latitudes, has a specific wintering strategy. After migrating ca. 1500 km from the Arctic to mid-latitudes, the birds continue to move throughout the entire over-wintering period, traveling another 1000 km southwest and then back northeast as the snowline advances. This continuous movement makes their wintering range dynamic throughout the season. In essence, this movement represents an extension of the quick migration process, albeit at a slower pace, and we have termed this migration pattern ‘foxtrot migration’, drawing an analogy to the alternating fast and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. These results highlight the potential errors in range mapping from single mid-winter surveys and emphasize the importance of this migration pattern in assessing the conservation status of bird species. Understanding this migration pattern could help to correctly estimate bird populations in over-wintering ranges, which is especially important for species that nest in hard-to-reach regions such as the Arctic.']",public,['12:RP87668'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-674X', 'prefLabel': 'Pokrovsky, Ivan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3VyaywgVGVqYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Curk, Teja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGlldHosIEFuZHJlYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Dietz, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnVmYWNoZXYsIEl2YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Fufachev, Ivan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VsaWtvdmEsIE9sZ2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Kulikova, Olga'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UsO2w59sZXIsIFNlYmFzdGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Rößler, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lrZWxza2ksIE1hcnRpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wikelski, Martin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Foxtrot migration and dynamic over-wintering range of an Arctic raptor'],2025-06-12T07:41:33.321+0200,336.0
frl:6511377,"['BACKGROUND: Gynecological cancers are among the most prevalent cancers in women worldwide. Brachytherapy, often used as a boost to external beam radiotherapy, is integral to treatment. Advances in computation, algorithms, and data availability have popularized the use of machine learning to predict patient outcomes. Recent studies have applied models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning networks to predict specific toxicities in patients who have undergone brachytherapy. OBJECTIVE: To develop and compare machine learning models for predicting grade 3 or higher toxicities in gynecological cancer patients treated with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, aiming to contribute to personalized radiation treatments. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on gynecological cancer patients who underwent HDR brachytherapy with Syed-Neblett or Tandem and Ovoid applicators from 2009 to 2023. After applying exclusion criteria, 233 patients were included in the analysis. Dosimetric variables for the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk, along with tumor, patient, and toxicity data, were collected and compared between groups with and without grade 3 or higher toxicities using statistical tests. Seven supervised classification machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and XGBoost) were constructed and evaluated. The training process involved sequential feature selection (SFS) when appropriate, followed by hyperparameter tuning. Final model performance was characterized using a 25% withheld test dataset. RESULTS: The top three ranking models were Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, with F1 testing scores of 0.63, 0.57, and 0.52; normMCC testing scores of 0.75, 0.77, and 0.71; and accuracy testing scores of 0.80, 0.85, and 0.81, respectively. The SFS algorithm selected 10 features for the highest-ranking model. In traditional statistical analysis, HR-CTV volume, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Length of Follow-Up, and D2cc - Rectum differed significantly between groups with and without grade 3 or higher toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models were developed to predict grade 3 or higher toxicities, achieving satisfactory performance.

Strategies to modulate the gut microbiome (i.e., fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)) may help to improve efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or even overcome resistance to ICIs. Here, we describe the design and rationale of FAB-HCC, a single-center, single-arm, phase II pilot study to assess safety, feasibility, and efficacy of FMT from patients with HCC who responded to PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy or from healthy donors to patients with HCC who failed to achieve or maintain a response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. METHODS: In this single-center, single-arm, phase II pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05750030), we plan to include 12 patients with advanced HCC who failed to achieve or maintain a response to atezolizumab/bevacizumab. Patients will receive a single FMT via colonoscopy from donors with HCC who responded to PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy or from healthy individuals, followed by atezolizumab/bevacizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint is safety, measured by incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events. The main secondary endpoint is efficacy, as assessed by best radiological response according to RECISTv1.1 and mRECIST. Additional exploratory endpoints include data on the effect of FMT on recipient gut microbiota, as well as metagenomic analysis of stool samples, analyses of circulating immune cells and serum and stool proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic signatures. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to define the potential of FMT as add-on intervention in the systemic treatment of advanced HCC, with the potential to improve efficacy of immunotherapy or even overcome resistance.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0321189'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2807-3565', 'prefLabel': 'Pomej, Katharina '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJpY2ssIEFkcmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Frick, Adrian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4904-5133', 'prefLabel': 'Scheiner, Bernhard'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6708-3061', 'prefLabel': 'Balcar, Lorenz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFqYW5jaWMsIExhcmlzc2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Pajancic, Larissa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xvdHosIEFudG9u', 'prefLabel': 'Klotz, Anton'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JldXRlciwgQWJlbGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kreuter, Abelina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFtcGljaGxlciwgS2F0aGFyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Lampichler, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVnbmF0LCBLYXRoYXJpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Regnat, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmlub2JlciwgS2Vyc3Rpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zinober, Kerstin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHJhdW5lciwgTWljaGFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Trauner, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFtYW5kbCwgRGlldG1hcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Tamandl, Dietmar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FzY2hlLCBDaHJpc3RvcGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Gasche, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7260-532X', 'prefLabel': 'Pinter, Matthias'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Study protocol: Fecal Microbiota Transplant combined with Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma who failed to achieve or maintain objective response to Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab – the FAB-HCC pilot study'],2025-05-14T13:08:35.661+0200,337.0

Despite the standard treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), approximately 10–20% of patients exhibit IVIG resistance, leading to persistent inflammation and an increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms（CAA）. The underlying molecular mechanisms driving KD, particularly the role of pyroptosis, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed integrative bioinformatics approaches to investigate the mechanistic role of pyroptosis in KD. By analyzing transcriptomic datasets, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with pyroptosis and immune dysregulation. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to uncover key co-expressed gene modules, followed by functional enrichment analyses to explore the biological significance of these genes. Through machine learning-based biomarker discovery, we identified MYD88 and S100A12 as critical pyroptosis-related genes in KD. Their diagnostic potential was validated using external datasets, and their involvement in immune cell infiltration was assessed through computational deconvolution techniques. Furthermore, drug repurposing analysis and molecular docking simulations suggested that Atogepant, Ubrogepant, and Zanubrutinib could serve as potential therapeutic candidates targeting S100A12 and MYD88.

With the availability of new targeted treatments, physicians are faced with the challenge of therapeutic decision-making tailored to traditional therapeutic goals, individual preferences, and personal experience, seeking optimal disease control with a positive safety profile. In this context of uncertainty and multiple novel choices, this study aims to provide insights into the preferred treatment choices of neurologists managing gMG and to identify demographic, professional or behavioral factors influencing the decision-making process. METHODS: This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional, web-based study involving 150 neurologists treating gMG patients in collaboration with the Spanish Society of Neurology. The primary endpoint will be to assess preferences for different gMG treatment attributes using a conjoint analysis to create hypothetical treatment scenarios. Therapeutic inertia, described as the lack of treatment initiation or intensification when therapeutic goals are not met, will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint through 7 case scenarios simulating real gMG clinical practice situations. Neurologists will also answer a survey composed of demographic, professional, and behavioral characteristics (user resistance behavior, care-related regret, burnout, risk attitude, empathy, work fulfilment, and personality traits) to recognize possible factors influencing decisions. CONCLUSION: The study findings will contribute to better understanding of decision-making in gMG under a changing therapeutic landscape with multiple new targeted options, and will identify which factors have a role in affecting those decisions.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0322168'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3V0acOpcnJlei1HdXRpw6lycmV6LCBHZXJhcmRv', 'prefLabel': 'Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez, Gerardo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9582-9230', 'prefLabel': 'Gómez, Rocío'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3400-1434', 'prefLabel': 'Sotoca, Javier'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJlcywgQWRyacOhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ares, Adrián'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlsbGF2ZXJkZSwgUmFtw7Nu', 'prefLabel': 'Villaverde, Ramón'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1058-3169', 'prefLabel': ', Virginia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJtYW5ndcOpLCBUaGHDrXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Armangué, Thaís'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FsYXMsIEVsaXNh', 'prefLabel': 'Salas, Elisa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMOtYXotQWLDs3MsIFBhb2xh', 'prefLabel': 'Díaz-Abós, Paola'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVib2xsbywgUGFibG8=', 'prefLabel': 'Rebollo, Pablo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FybWllbnRvLCBNw7NuaWNh', 'prefLabel': 'Sarmiento, Mónica'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXNjb2JhciwgSXJhdHhl', 'prefLabel': 'Escobar, Iratxe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF1cmlubywgSm9yZ2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Maurino, Jorge'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UXVlcm9sLCBMdWlz', 'prefLabel': 'Querol, Luis'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Assessing therapeutic decisions in generalized myasthenia gravis: Study protocol'],2025-05-12T14:22:05.935+0200,337.0
frl:6511238,"['BACKGROUND: Healthcare practitioners rely on research based on solid evidence for their clinical decisions, ensuring the provision of safe and effective patient care. The use of reporting guidelines and the registration of clinical trials enhance the reliability and credibility of research findings by promoting transparency and minimizing potential biases. However, it remains uncertain to what extent leading immunology and allergy journals have embraced these tools. This study aims to evaluate how commonly reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration are required and endorsed within leading immunology and allergy journals. METHODS: We identified the top 100 journals in the subcategory of “Immunology and Allergy” using the Scopus CiteScore tool for the year 2021. We thoroughly reviewed the “Instructions for Authors” section of each journal, focusing on indications related to specific reporting guidelines as outlined by the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network, as well as the practice of clinical trial registration. Our documentation categorized statements as “Not Mentioned,” “Recommended,” “Not Accepted,” or “Required.” The category “Not Accepted” specifically indicated that the journal explicitly did not accept the study designs associated with certain reporting guidelines, rather than implying bias against these guidelines. ensure equitable evaluation, we communicated with each journal to confirm the types of articles they accepted. RESULTS: Among the 100 journals assessed, the CONSORT guideline emerged as the most frequently cited, with 60 journals recommending adherence and 13 requiring it. Conversely, the QUOROM guideline was the least commonly cited, with merely two journals recommending its adherence and none requiring it. Nineteen journals did not reference a single reporting guideline. Remarkably, clinical trial registration was required by 42 journals and recommended by 34. CONCLUSION: This study reveals variation in the adoption of reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration in immunology and allergy journals. While some journals strongly advocate for or require these practices, others do not emphasize them at all. This inconsistency affects research rigor and reproducibility, highlighting the need for stricter enforcement. Editors should encourage these practices to enhance transparency and minimize biases.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0322003'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1358-5119', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Adam'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U21pdGgsIFRpbQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Smith, Tim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhdWRocnksIEFzYWFk', 'prefLabel': 'Chaudhry, Asaad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U21pdGgsIENhbGViIEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Smith, Caleb A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmVlcywgRGFueWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Nees, Danya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVnaGVzLCBHcmlmZmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Hughes, Griffin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um93c2V5LCBLYXlseW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Rowsey, Kaylyn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFzc2FyLCBNYXR0', 'prefLabel': 'Vassar, Matt'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A cross-sectional study on the endorsement of reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration among immunology and allergy journals'],2025-05-09T09:30:25.645+0200,337.0

Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38\u2009+\u2009tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.']",public,['20(5):e0321622'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6741-7386', 'prefLabel': 'Sampson, James'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEhvbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Hong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIERvbmdtZWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Dongmei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmksIE1pbmd5aW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Bi, Mingying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGludGhvcm5lLCBBZGFt', 'prefLabel': 'Hinthorne, Adam'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3llZCwgU2FrZWVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Syed, Sakeena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFl1aG9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Yuhong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhdHRvcGFkaHlheSwgTmliZWRpdGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Chattopadhyay, Nibedita'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29sbGlucywgU2FicmluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Collins, Sabrina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG9ndWUsIFNhcmFo', 'prefLabel': 'Pogue, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmrDtnJjaywgUGlh', 'prefLabel': 'Björck, Pia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-6621-4327', 'prefLabel': 'Curley, Michael '}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['CD38-targeted attenuated interferon alpha immunocytokine activates both innate and adaptive immune cells to drive anti-tumor activity'],2025-05-06T14:50:31.079+0200,337.0

The F–E–D formula, comprising Fructus Psoraleae, Eucommia, and Drynariae Rhizoma, has shown efficacy in treating OP. However, its complex natural components necessitate the screening and simplification of bioactive compounds to further elucidate their therapeutic mechanisms and enhance therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we first used drug–target binding to produce different effects, which in turn exhibited different retention characteristics on the stationary phase. Using osteoblasts and osteoclasts as stationary phases, a chromatographic system (Solid-phase Bio-cell Chromatography, SBC) had been constructed to mimic the drug–target interaction, and the separation, analysis, and bioactivity screening of the chemical components of F–E–D had been performed.

In this regard, rats were randomly divided into 6 groups as follows: normal diet controls, HFD (supplemented with high caloric diet model), EA low dose (HFD and 10\u2009mg/kg/day EA), EA middle dose (HFD and 25\u2009mg/kg/day EA), EA high dose (HFD and 50\u2009mg/kg/day EA), and Rosiglitazone (HFD and 10\u2009mg/kg/day Rosi). After the treatment, the levels of markers related to necroptosis and autophagy in the liver tissue as well as the lipid profiles, inflammation, and oxidative stress status were analyzed. It was shown that the dose of EA was able to improve the weight gain and lipid profile when compared to NAFLD animals (p-value <\u20090.001). Moreover, EA increased the level of LC3 and ATG5 while decreasing BECN 1, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD rats (p-value <\u20090.05).

frl:6526155,"['Micronutrient deficiencies remain a great public health challenge worldwide with iron, zinc, and vitamin A being the most problematic. It has been shown that biofortification through agronomic strategies can increase their micronutrient content, but data on the bioavailability remain limited. In Senegal, consumption of cereals and legumes is high, and orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP), rich in β-carotene, has been introduced a decade ago. The objective of the present work was to assess the bioaccessibility of iron, zinc, and β-carotene in local complementary foods prepared with millet, cowpea, and OFSP alone or in combination, produced using different agronomic biofortification strategies. Organic residual products were used alone or in combination with microorganisms to produce the abovementioned crops that were used to prepare the complementary foods. Static in vitro digestion was performed to assess the bioaccessibility of the micronutrients, according to a harmonized protocol. The two organic residual products had different effect, as the cow dung alone was inefficient to increase iron and zinc contents as well as their bioaccessibility in millet porridges. However, the use of poultry litter alone or in combination with microorganisms increased iron bioaccessibility in cooked cowpea (27%–29%) compared to the non-biofortified counterpart (9%). Surprisingly, bioaccessible β-carotene was significantly higher (4.1%) in sample of mashed OFSP biofortified with the combination of the different agronomic strategies than in the others (1.4%–2.5%). Portions (150\u2009g) of porridge prepared from the three biofortified crops would cover up to 100% of the daily vitamin A requirements of children aged 6–23\u2009months. The use of a combination the most promising varieties of crops, together with the agronomic strategies, would be a complementary approach to sustainability limit micronutrient deficiencies in a context of monotonous diets.']",public,['13(1):e4745'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4129-5090', 'prefLabel': 'THIAM, Mbeugué'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGlvdWYsIEFkYW1h', 'prefLabel': 'Diouf, Adama'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWNhcmQtVmVybmnDqHJlLCBDaHJpc3TDqGxl', 'prefLabel': 'Icard-Vernière, Christèle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7293-9565', 'prefLabel': 'AVALLONE, SYLVIE'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmRpYXllLCBOZMOoeWUgRmF0b3U=', 'prefLabel': 'Ndiaye, Ndèye Fatou'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGUgU291emEsIE1hcmllbGxlIEF0YWxh', 'prefLabel': 'de Souza, Marielle Atala'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0326-1364', 'prefLabel': 'Médoc, Jean-Michel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4515-7023', 'prefLabel': 'IDOHOU-DOSSOU, Nicole'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVtYmxvdCwgQ2hyaXN0w6hsZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Humblot, Christèle'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Improvement of Iron and β-Carotene Bioaccessibility in Complementary Foods: Biofortification of Local Crops With Organic Residual Products and Microorganisms'],2025-09-02T13:26:35.133+0200,286.0
frl:6511904,"['BACKGROUND: To combat the high prevalence of physical inactivity among children, there is an urgent need to develop and\r\nimplement real-world interventions and policies that promote physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviour (SB).\r\nTo inform policy makers, the current body of evidence for children’s PA/SB interventions needs to be translated.\r\nObjectives The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify modifiable determinants of device-measured\r\nPA and SB targeted in available intervention studies with randomized controlled trial (RCT) and controlled trial (CT) designs in children and early adolescents (5–12 years) and to quantify the effects of the interventions within their respective settings on the determinants of PA/SB and the outcomes PA and SB. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and CENTRAL. Studies were considered if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials (CTs), included children and/or early adolescents (5–12 years; henceforth termed children), measured PA and/or SB using device-based methods and measured PA and/or SB and determinants of PA/SB at least at two timepoints. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomised Trials (RoB2) for RCTs and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for CTs. The quality of the generated evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Robust Bayesian meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of the interventions on the determinants of PA/SB, and the outcomes PA and SB, stratifying by study design, duration of PA/SB measurement, intervention setting and duration of follow-up measurement. Study characteristics and interventions were summarized. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included with a total sample size of n = 14,258 (67% girls). Settings identified were school, family/home, community and combinations of these. The review identified 38 modifiable determinants, spanning seven categories on individual, interpersonal and physical environmental levels, with 66% of determinants on the individual level. Overall, the results indicated trivial-to-moderate effects of the interventions on the determinants of PA and SB, with mostly trivial level of evidence for the presence of an effect (as indicated by a small Bayes factor; BF 10 < 3.00). The exceptions were moderate effects on parental PA modelling in the family/home setting and SB measured during specific parts of the school day. Higher quality of evidence was found in the family/home setting compared with other settings. DISCUSSION: Overall, the results indicated that interventions have neither been effective in modifying the determinants of PA/SB, nor changing the PA/SB outcomes in children. In general, the approach in the current review revealed the breadth of\r\nmethodological variability in children’s PA interventions. Research is needed to address novel approaches to children’s PA research and to identify potential determinants to inform policy and future interventions.

To understand whether FPE-FGE could alleviate menopause with dyslipidemia, we examined their effects on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced dyslipidemia in mice. Oral administration of the FPE-FGE (1:9, 3:7, and 9:1) did not affect safety-related biomarkers, such as uterus index (%), vagina index (%), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Furthermore, FPE-FGE (1:9, 3:7, and 9:1) increased the levels of 17β-estradiol (E2) and expression of uterus estrogen receptor β (ERβ); there was little effect on the expression of uterus estrogen receptor α (ERα), and reduced the levels of gonadotropins, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, only the FPE-FGE (3:7) reduced the levels of blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Accordingly, FPE-FGE (3:7) upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitric oxide (NO), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG).

frl:6511101,"['Barley is a diploid species with a genome smaller than those of other members of the Triticeae tribe, making it an attractive model for genetic studies in Triticeae crops. The recent development of barley genomics has created a need for a high-throughput platform to identify genetically uniform mutants for genes functional investigation. In this study, we reported an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population consisting of 8,525 M3 lines in the barley landrace ‘Hatiexi’ (HTX), which we complement with a high-quality de novo assembly of a reference genome for this genotype. The mutation rate within the population ranged from 1.51 to 4.09 mutations per Mb, depending on the treatment dosage of EMS and the mutation discrimination platform employed for genotype analysis. We implemented a three-dimensional DNA pooling strategy combined with multiplexed amplicon-sequencing to create a highly efficient and cost-effective TILLING (Targeting Induced Locus Lesion IN Genomes) platform in barley. Mutations were successfully identified from 72 mixed amplicons within a DNA pool containing 64 individual mutants, and from 56 mixed amplicons within a pool containing 144 individuals. We discovered abundant allelic mutants for dozens of genes, including the barley green revolution contributor gene Brassinosteroid insensitive1 (BRI1). As a proof of concept, we rapidly determined the causal gene responsible for a chlorotic mutant by following the MutMap strategy, demonstrating the value of this resource to support forward and reverse genetic studies in barley.']",public,['3(4):100317'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhbmcsIENvbmdjb25n', 'prefLabel': 'Jiang, Congcong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVpLCBNaWFvbWlhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Lei, Miaomiao'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5424-5797', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Yu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FvLCBHdWFuZ3Fp', 'prefLabel': 'Gao, Guangqi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpLCBMaWppZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Shi, Lijie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmluLCBZYW5sb25n', 'prefLabel': 'Jin, Yanlong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FpLCBZdQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cai, Yu'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-0946', 'prefLabel': 'Himmelbach, Axel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvdSwgU2hlbmdodWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Shenghui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGUsIFFpYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'He, Qiang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFvLCBYdWVmZW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Yao, Xuefeng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FuLCBKaW5ob25n', 'prefLabel': 'Kan, Jinhong'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6612-6939', 'prefLabel': 'Haberer, Georg'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHVhbiwgRmVuZ3lpbmcg', 'prefLabel': 'Duan, Fengying '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIExpaHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Lihui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKdW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEppbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Jing'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0701-7035', 'prefLabel': 'Spannagl, Manuel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBDaHVubWluZyA=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Chunming '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-8731', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Nils'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmVuZywgWm9uZ3l1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Feng, Zongyun'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-6013', 'prefLabel': 'Mascher, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6977-8449', 'prefLabel': 'YANG, PING'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A reference-guided TILLING by amplicon-seq platform supports forward and reverse genetics in barley'],2025-04-16T14:22:00.863+0200,325.0
frl:6510317,"[""Hypercholesteremia is the main contributor to metabolic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, which are the primary global sources of morbidity and death rates. Garlic scapes, a member of the Allium sativum family and a rich source of antioxidants, are utilized in various cuisine preparations due to their unique flavors and tastes. The current study examined garlic scape powder's effect on apoprotein E and its ability to decrease cholesterol. In an in vivo experiment, normal, healthy Wistar albino rats (weeks) were divided into a negative control group (NC, n\u2009=\u200910) and a high-fat diet-raised group (n\u2009=\u200950) until they achieved cholesterol ≥250\u2009mg/dL. Hypercholesteremic rats were further divided randomly into five groups: positive control (PC), standard group (fenofibrate 20\u2009mg/kg bwt), and treatment groups G1, G2, and G3 that were administered with garlic scape powder 400\u2009mg, 800\u2009mg, and 1200\u2009mg/kg bwt orally, respectively, for 3 months. The blood samples were examined for cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), low-density lipoproteins, apoprotein E, albumin levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The liver tissues of the rats were subjected to histopathology. The lipid profile was assessed using serum kit techniques, whereas an ELISA kit was used to evaluate apoprotein E, and a serum kit was used to estimate ALT and AST. In comparison to all other groups except NC, the highest dose of 1200\u2009mg/kg bwt of garlic scapes significantly (p\u2009≤\u2009.05) increased serum insulin (13.66\u2009±\u20090.72 μU/mL), apoprotein E levels (6.08\u2009±\u20090.10\u2009mg/dL), HDL (42.1\u2009±\u20091.81\u2009mg/dL), and reduce TG (88.7\u2009±\u20091.64\u2009mg/dL) and decreased overall cholesterol levels (67.9\u2009±\u20091.17\u2009mg/dL). Except for NC, all treatment groups had significantly (p\u2009≤\u2009.05) lower ALT and AST values than PC. To sum up, powdered garlic scapes may be a great way to avoid hyperlipidemia, which raises the risk of cardiovascular illnesses. ALT and AST levels were significantly (p\u2009≤\u2009.05) reduced in all treatment groups compared to PC, except for NC. In conclusion, garlic scape powder may be an excellent source to prevent hyperlipidemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In addition, powdered garlic scapes supplementation at high doses may be used as an alternative natural source in functional foods to halt hyperlipidemia without liver toxicity in the long term.""]",public,['12(10):7607-7619'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXRyYXQsIE5pendh', 'prefLabel': 'Itrat, Nizwa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmlzYSwgTWFociBVbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Nisa, Mahr Un'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwtQXNtYXJpLCBGYWhhZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Al-Asmari, Fahad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFtYWRhbiwgTW9oYW1lZCBGYXd6eQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Ramadan, Mohamed Fawzy'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9885-8301', 'prefLabel': 'Eliasse, ZONGO'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['A double-blind, randomized control trial to investigate the therapeutic potential of garlic scapes for high apoprotein E levels in a high-Fat diet-induced hypercholesteremic rat model']",2025-03-06T11:07:50.832+0100,286.0
frl:6511384,"['Firefighting operations in high-rise building fires require firefighters to navigate complex environments while undertaking physically demanding, heavy-load tasks, which often lead to severe fatigue, impairing their operational efficiency and decision-making. This study aims to develop a robust fatigue classification and prediction model to assess and forecast firefighters’ fatigue levels. Key metrics, including electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, subjective fatigue ratings, and reaction time data, were utilized. Experiments involving six healthy adult male participants simulated firefighting scenarios, during which subjective fatigue levels (6–20 Borg’s RPE scale) and reaction times were recorded. A five-level fatigue classification was established using K-means clustering, and entropy weight analysis was applied to define a comprehensive fatigue index (F), enabling a three-tier fatigue classification: light, moderate, and severe fatigue. A BP neural network was employed for dynamic fatigue prediction, with 10 features derived from heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) metrics serving as inputs and the comprehensive fatigue index (F) as the output. The BP neural network model achieved a high prediction accuracy with an R² value of 93.24%, demonstrating its capability to accurately predict firefighters’ fatigue states. This approach provides a scientific basis for optimizing firefighter training protocols and enhancing operational effectiveness during fire rescue missions. The findings highlight the significant potential of this method for advancing firefighter fatigue monitoring and management.']",public,['20(5):e0323911'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8069-0221', 'prefLabel': 'XU, Mingwei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgU2hhbmd4dWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Shangxue'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgS2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Ke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIENoZW5nbGl1', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Chengliu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBHdWFubGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Guanlin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFpLCBDaGFv', 'prefLabel': 'Dai, Chao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgUnVpcWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Ruiqi'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A study on the classification and prediction of firefighter’s operational fatigue level'],2025-05-16T11:02:17.507+0200,337.0

RESULTS: A global SVD score (range 0-4) was associated with cognitive impairment; worse performance in executive function, attention, language, and visuospatial ability; and worse functional outcome across a 12-month follow-up. Although the global SVD score did not improve prediction, individual SVD markers, assessed across their severity range, improved the calibration, discrimination, and reclassification of predictive models including demographic, clinical, and other imaging factors. DISCUSSION: SVD presence and severity are associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes 12 months after stroke. Assessing SVD severity may aid prognostication for stroke patients. HIGHLIGHTS: In a multi-center cohort, we explored associations of small vessel disease (SVD) burden with stroke outcomes. SVD burden associates with post-stroke cognitive and functional outcomes. A currently used score of SVD burden does not improve the prediction of poor outcomes. Assessing the severity of SVD lesions adds predictive value beyond known predictors. To add predictive value in assessing SVD in stroke patients, SVD burden scores should integrate lesion severity.']",public,['19(4):1152-1163'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2Vvcmdha2lzLCBNYXJpb3MgSy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Georgakis, Marios K.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFuZywgUm9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Fang, Rong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMO8cmluZywgTWFyY28=', 'prefLabel': 'Düring, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29sbGVud2ViZXIsIEZyYW5rIEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Wollenweber, Frank A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9kZSwgRmVsaXggSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bode, Felix J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3TDtnNzZXIsIFNlYmFzdGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Stösser, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2luZGxlaW4sIENocmlzdGluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kindlein, Christine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVybWFubiwgUGV0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Hermann, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGltYW4sIFRob21hcyBHLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Liman, Thomas G.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tm9sdGUsIENocmlzdGlhbiBILg==', 'prefLabel': 'Nolte, Christian H.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2VydGksIEx1Y2lh', 'prefLabel': 'Kerti, Lucia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWtlbmJlcmcsIEJlbm5v', 'prefLabel': 'Ikenberg, Benno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVybmtvcGYsIEthdGhsZWVu', 'prefLabel': 'Bernkopf, Kathleen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG9wcGVydCwgSG9sZ2Vy', 'prefLabel': 'Poppert, Holger'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhbnosIFdlbnplbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Glanz, Wenzel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVyb3NhLCBWYWxlbnRpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Perosa, Valentina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFub3dpdHosIERhbmllbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Janowitz, Daniel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FnbmVyLCBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmV1bWFubiwgS2F0amE=', 'prefLabel': 'Neumann, Katja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6019-5597', 'prefLabel': 'Speck, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9iaXNjaCwgTGF1cmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Dobisch, Laura'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMO8emVsLCBFbXJhaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Düzel, Emrah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VzaWVyaWNoLCBCZW5ubw==', 'prefLabel': 'Gesierich, Benno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV3ZW50ZXIsIEFubmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Dewenter, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BvdHRrZSwgQW5uaWth', 'prefLabel': 'Spottke, Annika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FlZ2VtYW5uLCBLYXJpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Waegemann, Karin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R8O2cnRsZXIsIE1pY2hhZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Görtler, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3VuZGVybGljaCwgU2lsa2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Wunderlich, Silke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RW5kcmVzLCBNYXR0aGlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Endres, Matthias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVyciwgSW5nYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zerr, Inga'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0em9sZCwgR2Fib3I=', 'prefLabel': 'Petzold, Gabor'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGljaGdhbnMsIE1hcnRpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Dichgans, Martin'}]",2023.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Cerebral small vessel disease burden and cognitive and functional outcomes after stroke: A multicenter prospective cohort study'],2025-05-14T14:15:07.452+0200,242.0

The aim is to analyse the context in which the programme was delivered, assess key implementation outcomes and explore mechanisms of action. METHODS: We used mixed methods. Quantitative data came from routine randomised control trial monitoring and structured observation, and qualitative data were collected using semi-structured, in-depth interviews with trial participants (n\u2009=\u200912) and decision-makers (n\u2009=\u20097) and a focus group discussion with intervention providers (n\u2009=\u20097). We conducted a descriptive analysis of quantitative data using R software and a thematic analysis of qualitative data using NVivo. RESULTS: Context analysis revealed implementation barriers, including unrealistic expectations of participants about the programme and mental health-related stigma. The flexibility of interventions and the opportunity for mental health actions were enabling factors. Implementation outcomes showed that the trial was feasible, appropriate and timely, and that the intervention was delivered with minimal protocol deviations and good acceptance among participants. Mechanisms of action included confidence in the positive effect of the intervention, a good therapeutic relationship and specific intervention components. CONCLUSIONS: These results supplement the outcome evaluation and can help inform large-scale implementation in similar settings. Specific recommendations include increasing mental health awareness and reducing stigma in the implementation setting, including a short orientation session and ensuring flexibility in schedules and peer support.

frl:6510800,"['Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to execute future intentions. PM requires engagement of attentional networks, in which oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency range has been implicated. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal cortex are assumed to be engaged during PM tasks. We hypothesized that the selective application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at alpha frequency to these areas can modulate PM-associated event-related potentials. Participants were assigned to alpha-tACS, theta-tACS, or Sham stimulation. They performed a working memory task (OGT), with a PM component, pre-, during, and post-stimulation. EEG was recorded post-stimulation. Accuracy and reaction times (RTs) were computed. Following EEG source reconstruction of mean amplitude, source activity was contrasted between conditions in which performance was modulated by tACS using cluster-based permutation tests. RTs were slower on introducing the PM task, consistent with strategic monitoring. PM accuracy improved in the alpha-tACS group only. During PM trials, source activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was lower following alpha-tACS than after Sham stimulation. Source activity in the DLPFC following alpha-tACS was lower during PM than in OGT trials following alpha-tACS. Performance modulation through alpha-tACS, and the lower DLPFC activity in PM than in OGT trials provide evidence of a role for alpha oscillations during strategic monitoring for a PM cue. Lower PCC activity in the alpha-tACS than Sham group is consistent with facilitation of disengagement of the default mode network, supporting re-direction of attention from the OGT to the PM task and task-switching.

This study was, therefore, designed to examine CT's potential as an anticancer agent against glioblastoma (GBM). Network pharmacology analysis was employed to identify potential anticancer targets of CT. A comprehensive data mining was carried out to assess CT and GBM-associated target genes. Protein–protein interaction network was constructed to identify hub genes and later GO and KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to elucidate the possible mechanism. Human glioblastoma cell line “SF767” was used to confirm in silico findings. MTT, crystal violet, and trypan blue assays were performed to assess the cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of CT. Subsequently, ELISA and qPCR were performed to analyze the effects of CT on proapoptotic and inflammatory mediators. In silico findings indicated that CT differentially regulated proapoptotic and inflammatory pathways by activating caspase-3 and 8 and inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Molecular docking also demonstrated strong binding affinities of CT with the above-mentioned mediators when compared to 5-fluorouracil or temozolomide. In SF767 cell line, CT displayed dose-dependent cytotoxic and antioxidant effects, and upregulation of annexin-V, caspase-3, and 8 along with downregulation of inflammatory modulators. In a nutshell, it can be concluded from these findings that CT possesses robust anticancer activity which is mediated via differential regulation of caspase-3, JAK2, and NF-κB pathways.""]",public,['13(1):e4678'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2657-9810', 'prefLabel': 'Malik, Muhammad Nasir Hayat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxpLCBTdWZ5YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ali, Sufyan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8338-4232', 'prefLabel': 'Ali, Amir'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxhbnppLCBBYmR1bGxhaCBSLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Alanzi, Abdullah R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXRpZiwgTXVoYW1tYWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Atif, Muhammad'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0638-1601', 'prefLabel': 'Alharbi, Hattan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgQm93ZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Bowen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF6YSwgTW9vc2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Raza, Moosa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFxYm9vbCwgVGFoaXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Maqbool, Tahir'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5884-8950', 'prefLabel': 'Anjum, Dr. Irfan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFoYW4sIFNoYWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Jahan, Shah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxzaGFtbWFyaSwgU2F1ZCBPLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Alshammari, Saud O.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2861-0674', 'prefLabel': 'SOLRE, GIDEON F.

Intervention effects on the determinants and their associations with self-report PAB/SB were assessed across settings. Search of relevant interventions from pre-defined databases was conducted up to July 2023. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials with modifiable determinants were included. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two independent researchers. Where data could be pooled, we performed Robust Bayesian meta-analyses. Heterogeneity, publication bias and certainty of evidence were assessed. Fifteen studies were deemed eligible to be included. Thirty-seven unique determinants within four settings were identified–school, family, school with family/home, and community with(out) other settings. Ninety-eight percent of determinants belonged to individual/interpersonal determinant categories. Narratively, intervention effects on student perception of teachers’ behaviour (school), self-management, perceived barriers, external motivation, exercise intention, parental modeling on SB (school with family/home) and MVPA expectations (community) were weak to strong, however, corresponding PAB/SB change was not evident. There were negligible effects for all other determinants and the corresponding PAB/SB. Meta-analyses on self-efficacy, attitude, subjective norm and parental practice and PAB/SB in two settings showed weak to strong evidence against intervention effect, while the effect on knowledge could not be determined. Similarly, publication bias and heterogeneity for most analyses could not be ascertained. We found no concrete evidence of association between the modifiable determinants and self-report PAB/SB in any settings. This is presumably due to intervention ineffectiveness. Design of future interventions should consider to follow the systems-based approach and identify determinants unique to the context of a setting, including policy and environmental determinants.']",public,['19(11):e0309890'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2357-3779', 'prefLabel': 'Ling, Fiona Chun Man'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2h1ZGFpciwgTW9oYW1tZWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Khudair, Mohammed'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmcsIEt3b2s=', 'prefLabel': 'Ng, Kwok'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVtcGVzdCwgR2F2aW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Tempest, Gavin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVyaWMsIFJhdGtv', 'prefLabel': 'Peric, Ratko'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0018-5573', 'prefLabel': 'Bartoš, František'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFpZXIsIE1heGltaWxpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Maier, Maximilian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2926-4758', 'prefLabel': 'Brandes, Mirko'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FybGluLCBBbmdlbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Carlin, Angela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2lhY2Npb25pLCBTaW1vbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Ciaccioni, Simone'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29ydGlzLCBDcmlzdGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cortis, Cristina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29ydmlubywgQ2hpYXJh', 'prefLabel': 'Corvino, Chiara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGkgQ3JlZGljbywgQW5kcmVh', 'prefLabel': 'Di Credico, Andrea'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2075-6038', 'prefLabel': 'Drid, Patrik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FsbMOoLCBGcmFuY2VzY2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Gallè, Francesca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXp6aWN1cG8sIFBhc2NhbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Izzicupo, Pascal'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFocmUsIEhlbnJpZXR0ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jahre, Henriette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29sb3ZlbG9uaXMsIEF0aGFuYXNpb3M=', 'prefLabel': 'Kolovelonis, Athanasios'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29uZ3N2b2xkLCBBdGxl', 'prefLabel': 'Kongsvold, Atle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S291aWRpLCBFdmFuZ2VsaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Kouidi, Evangelia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3355-2680', 'prefLabel': 'Mork, Paul Jarle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFsdW1ibywgRmVkZXJpY28=', 'prefLabel': 'Palumbo, Federico'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVtYm9sZCwgUGVubnkgTG91aXNlIFNoZWVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Rumbold, Penny Louise Sheena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FuZHUsIFBldHJ1', 'prefLabel': 'Sandu, Petru'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3Rhdm5zYm8sIE1ldHRl', 'prefLabel': 'Stavnsbo, Mette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3lybXBhcywgSW9hbm5pcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Syrmpas, Ioannis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlsZWxhLCBTb2ZpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Vilela, Sofia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29vZHMsIENhdGhlcmluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Woods, Catherine'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9400-4130', 'prefLabel': 'Wunsch, Kathrin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FwcmFuaWNhLCBMYXVyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Capranica, Laura'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFjRG9ubmNoYSwgQ2lhcmFu', 'prefLabel': 'MacDonncha, Ciaran'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFyY3V6emksIEFubmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Marcuzzi, Anna'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['DE-PASS best evidence statement (BESt): Determinants of self-report physical activity and sedentary behaviours in children in setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis'],2025-03-11T10:41:25.613+0100,266.0

In particular, it remains unclear which pandemic-related stress response pattern occurs in pre-existing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic - at the same time these patients potentially exhibit dysfunctional coping of artificially generated psychosocial stressors. To analyze this so far widely unconsidered pandemic-related stress response in PTSD, this study longitudinally measured psychosocial burden and adjustment disorder (AD) symptom load in 14 patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of PTSD vs. a cohort of 145 psychiatric patients without PTSD. The previously established Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) was used. Patients were interviewed at the end of the first (April/May 2020) and the second nationwide lockdown in Germany (November/December 2020). In our convenience sample, psychiatric disorders were diagnosed by patients' treating clinicians prior to study inclusion. Psychosocial burden and AD symptom load were significantly higher in patients with PTSD than in patients without PTSD over the course of the pandemic (both p = .005). Moreover, explorative analysis of Goe-BSI-assessed general psychiatric symptoms did not reveal changes during the pandemic in patients with PTSD. In sum, we provide preliminary evidence that, in relation to psychiatric patients without PTSD, those with PTSD might experience a higher pandemic-related burden and might thus cope less efficiently with this enduring real-world stressor. This study is limited inter alia by the small sample size and by the underrepresentation of some psychiatric diagnoses.

frl:6510956,"['Introduction: Understanding the dynamics of Pb tolerance across different growth stages is essential for breeding wheat varieties with comprehensive tolerance to Pb contamination throughout their life cycle. Lead (Pb) in soil affects wheat plants at all growth stages. However, the seedling stage is considered a sensitive growth stage for the tolerance of most abiotic stresses. Genetic variation in lead tolerance is poorly understood, and genetic control has still not been investigated.\r\nMaterials: In this study, 103 highly diverse wheat genotypes were investigated under normal and lead stress conditions at the seedling stage. Different seedling growth traits were scored under each treatment. GWAS was performed via two different sets of markers: 21,750 (25K Infinium iSelect array) and 37,790 SNPs (genotyping-by-sequencing) to identify SNP markers associated with the studied seedling traits.\r\nResults: High genetic variation was found among all the genotypes for all the traits. High broad-sense heritability estimates ranging from 0.25-0.93 were observed. A highly significant correlation was found among all the traits scored under normal and lead stress conditions. Low or no significant phenotypic correlations were found for lead tolerance between the seedling and adult growth stages. A set of eight genotypes were classified as lead-tolerant genotypes. The GWAS revealed a set of 222 significant markers associated with lead tolerance. Markers with pleiotropic effects were detected under Pb stress and between lead and normal conditions. Interestingly, five significant markers were found to be associated with lead tolerance at the seedling and adult growth stages.\r\nDiscussion: The results of this study provide new and novel insights into genetic control and genetic variation in lead tolerance at the early growth stage. All the genes and genotypes reported in this study will be very useful for further investigations of lead tolerance in wheat at different growth stages.']",public,['7:1428366'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6879-2559', 'prefLabel': 'Mourad, Amira'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7811-728X', 'prefLabel': 'Sallam, Ahmed'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFyZ2hhbHksIEtoYWxlZCBB', 'prefLabel': 'Farghaly, Khaled A'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/MDAwMC0wMDAzLTMzMDEtOTAyNg==', 'prefLabel': '0000-0003-3301-9026'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Detailed genetic analyses highlight genetic variation and genomic regions for lead tolerance in spring wheat'],2025-04-10T11:36:03.722+0200,325.0

The AlgNPs containing both menthol and the EO showed the most potent antimicrobial activity (the lowest counts of pseudomonas, aerobic mesophilic, and yeast-mold), during cold storage. This coating treatment showed also the highest antioxidant activities, with the lowest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), pH and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) values. Moreover, this coating significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) showed the highest sensory quality of chicken thighs, as evidenced by the higher sensory scores for texture, odor, color, and overall acceptability. Therefore, the edible coating based on AlgNPs containing menthol and Z. multiflora EO is an effective and promising approach for extending the shelf life of chicken thighs.']",public,['13(1):e4684'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFuamJhciwgQWxp', 'prefLabel': 'Ranjbar, Ali'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T3NhbmxvbywgTWFobW91ZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Osanloo, Mahmoud'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FmYXJpLCBNb2pkZWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Safari, Mojdeh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXNrYW5kYXJpLCBaYWhyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Eskandari, Zahra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FmYXJpLCBFaHNhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Safari, Ehsan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-7745', 'prefLabel': 'nematollahi, amene'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Edible Coating Based on Alginate Nanoparticles Containing Menthol and Zataria multiflora Essential Oil: Effect on the Shelf Life of Chicken Thigh in the Refrigerator'],2025-07-02T11:26:44.194+0200,286.0
frl:6511283,"['BACKGROUND: Mobility is crucial for participation and quality of life in individuals with sensorimotor impairments, yet scientific evidence on its course in real-world settings is limited. So-called wearables for measuring physical activity might help to overcome this knowledge gap allowing daily measurements of mobility. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between clinical walking tests and inertial measurement unit-based mobility tracking in the community setting of stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI) survivors. METHODS: At a single observational time point, the precision of the activity tracker was evaluated in a standardized parcours in healthy subjects and stroke or SCI survivors (n=57). This was followed by a multicenter observational cohort study (n=116 participants), in which the mobility of stroke and SCI survivors was assessed over 8 months immediately after discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation. Daily distances covered in the community setting were recorded using the activity tracker. Established walking tests-including the 10-meter walk test (10MWT) and the timed up and go test (TUG)-were conducted at baseline, as well as at 4- and 8-month follow up visits. The relationship between daily distances in the ambulatory setting and 10MWT or TUG performance at discrete study visits (baseline, 4 months (midterm), and 8 months (final) after hospital discharge) was analyzed using regression models.\r\nRESULTS: The precision of the activity tracker in measuring covered distance in a standardized parcours varied by mobility type. The highest precision was achieved in manual wheelchair users (deviation from zero: -1.5±1.03% (p=0.15) while the least favorable precision was observed in participants with SCI and significant walking impairment (-14.6±2% (p<0.001). The widely used 10MWT speed showed a relationship with the ambulatory daily distance. The regression coefficients [m/(1m/s)] were: 874 (95% CI: 578-1171) at baseline (p<0.001), 895 (95% CI: 614-1176) at midterm (p<0.001), and 824 (95% CI: 537-1112) at the final visit (p<0.001). Interestingly, in the category of good walkers with the most favorable walking speeds the daily covered distance unmasked distinct subgroups with shorter and longer daily distances. CONCLUSIONS: For SCI and stroke survivors, especially medium to fast walkers, activity tracking in real-world settings adds valuable insight beyond clinical walking tests. Clinical studies on rehabilitative interventions for mobility improvement should consider real-life daily distance as a key endpoint.

frl:6511156,"['Prospective memory, or memory for future intentions, engages particular cortical regions. Lesion studies also implicate the thalamus, with prospective memory deterioration following thalamic stroke. Neuroimaging, anatomical and lesion studies suggest the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT), in particular, are involved in episodic memory, with electrophysiological studies suggesting an active role in selecting neural assemblies underlying particular memory traces. Here, we hypothesized that the ANT are engaged in realizing prospectively-encoded intentions, detectable using ultra-high-field strength functional MRI. Using a within-subject design, participants (N = 14; age 20-35 years) performed an ongoing n-back working memory task with two cognitive loads, each with and without a prospective memory component, during 7-Tesla functional MRI. Seed-to-voxel whole brain functional connectivity analyses were performed to establish whether including a prospective memory component in an ongoing task results in greater connectivity between ANT and cortical regions engaged in prospective memory. Repeated measures ANOVAs were applied to behavioral and connectivity measures, with the factors Task Type (with prospective memory or not) and N-Back (2-back or 3-back). Response accuracy was greater and reaction times faster without the prospective memory component, and accuracy was higher in the 2- than 3-back condition. Task Type had a main effect on connectivity with an ANT seed, with greater ANT-DLPFC and ANT-STG connectivity when including a prospective memory component. Post hoc testing based on a significant interaction showed greater ANT-DLPFC connectivity (p-FWE = 0.007) when prospective memory was included with the low cognitive load and ANT-STG connectivity (p-FWE = 0.019) with the high cognitive load ongoing task. Direct comparison showed greater functional connectivity between these areas and the ANT than dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus (DMNT) during prospective remembering. Enhanced ANT-DLPFC connectivity, a brain region with an established role in strategic monitoring for prospective memory cues, arose with a low cognitive load ongoing task that enabled monitoring. This connectivity was significantly less on direct comparison with increasing the cognitive load of the ongoing task without prospective memory, suggesting specificity for prospective memory. Greater ANT-STG connectivity on prospective memory inclusion in the higher cognitive load ongoing task fits with reported STG activation on prospective memory through spontaneous retrieval. Lower connectivity on direct comparison with a DMNT seed suggests ANT specificity. The findings fit with a coordinating role for the ANT in prospective remembering. Given the small sample, these findings should be considered preliminary, with replication required.

Additionally, this study sought to external validation of the CNN models in addition to the linear regression (LM), random forest (RF), and full connected neural network (FcNN) models published in Steenbock et al (2019 J. Meas. Phys. Behav. 2 94–102). APPROACH: Included in this study were 41 German children (3.0–6.99 years) for the training and internal validation who were equipped with GENEActiv, GT3X+, and activPAL accelerometers. The external validation dataset consisted of 39 Canadian children (3.0–5.99 years) that were equipped with OPAL, GT9X, GENEActiv, and GT3X+ accelerometers. EE was recorded simultaneously in both datasets using a portable metabolic unit. The protocols consisted of a semi-structured activities ranging from low to high intensities. The root mean square error (RMSE) values were calculated and used to evaluate model performances. MAIN RESULTS: (1) The CNNs outperformed the LM (13.17%–23.81% lower mean RMSE values), FcNN (8.13%–27.27% lower RMSE values) and the RF models (3.59%–18.84% lower RMSE values) in the internal dataset. (2) In contrast, it was found that when applied to the external Canadian dataset, the CNN models had consistently higher RMSE values compared to the LM, FcNN, and RF. SIGNIFICANCE: Although CNNs can enhance EE prediction accuracy, their ability to generalize to new datasets and accelerometer brands/models, is more limited compared to LM, RF, and FcNN models.']",public,['45(9):095015'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6138-1463', 'prefLabel': 'Coyle-Asbil, Hannah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVyaywgTHVrYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Burk, Lukas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2926-4758', 'prefLabel': 'Brandes, Mirko'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0261-704X', 'prefLabel': 'Buck, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8542-6291', 'prefLabel': 'Wright, Marvin N.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3970-9159', 'prefLabel': 'Vallis, Lori Ann'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Energy expenditure prediction in preschool children: a machine learning approach using accelerometry and external validation'],2025-03-11T12:14:34.553+0100,266.0

Two diets prepared with 92% fermented quinoa or 79.5% fermented canihua were compared with diets prepared with the same amount of non-fermented pseudocereals. Other two quinoa diets were prepared with 60% non-fermented or fermented quinoa and compared with a refence diet which was free of phytates. Body weight, feed efficiency ratio, and the absorption, retention and bioavailability of iron and zinc were evaluated. While body weight and feed efficiency ratio were higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in animals after non-fermented diets, the results of mineral absorption and bioavailability were consistently higher in the diets containing fermented pseudocereals. Iron concentration in the livers of animals after the fermented quinoa (92%) and canihua diet (79.5%), were 34% and 30% higher than after the diets with non-fermented pseudocereals. Zinc bioavailability, indicated by zinc in femur of animals fed the 60% fermented quinoa diet was 53.2\u2009μg\u2009g−1\u2009ZnInt\u2009g−1\u2009BW, comparable to that in animals fed a reference diet with no phytates (58.2\u2009μg\u2009g−1\u2009ZnInt g−1\u2009BW), and significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) than in animals fed the non-fermented quinoa diet (34.5\u2009μg\u2009g−1\u2009ZnInt\u2009g−1\u2009BW). Zinc bioavailability was mainly influenced by phytate content in the diet (R2\u2009=\u20090.665 and p\u2009=\u20090.000). The retention of iron in the liver (2220\u2009μg\u2009g−1\u2009FeInt\u2009g−1\u2009BW) was higher in the diet containing 60% of fermented quinoa than in the non-fermented diet (1429\u2009μg\u2009g−1\u2009ZnInt\u2009g−1\u2009BW).

frl:6511923,"['BACKGROUND: Intake of sweet and fatty snacks may partly contribute to the occurrence of obesity and other health conditions in childhood. Traditional dietary assessment methods may be limited in accurately assessing the intake of sweet and fatty snacks in children. Metabolite biomarkers may aid the objective assessment of children’s food intake and support establishing diet–disease relationships. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to identify biomarkers of sweet and fatty snack intake in 2 independent cohorts of European children. METHODS: We used data from the IDEFICS/I.Family cohort from baseline (2007/2008) and 2 follow-up examination waves (2009/2010 and 2013/2014). In total, 1788 urine samples from 599 children were analyzed for untargeted metabolomics using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Short-term dietary intake was assessed by 24-h dietary recalls, and habitual dietary intake was calculated with the National Cancer Institute method. Data from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinal Designed (DONALD) cohort of 24-h urine samples (n = 567) and 3-d weighted dietary records were used for external replication of results. Multivariate modeling with unbiased variable selection in R algorithms and linear mixed models were used to identify novel biomarkers. Metabolite features significantly associated with dietary intake were then annotated. RESULTS: In total, 66 metabolites were discovered and found to be statistically significant for chocolate candy; cakes, puddings, and cookies; candy and sweets; ice cream; and crisps. Most of the features (n = 62) could not be annotated. Short-term and habitual chocolate intake were positively associated with theobromine, xanthosine, and cyclo(L-prolyl-L-valyl).

To this end, traditional genebanks are evolving into biodigital resource centers where the integration of phenotypic and genotypic data for accessions can drive more informed decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and unlock new opportunities for plant breeding and research. However, the curation and availability of interoperable phenotypic and genotypic data for genebank accessions is still in its infancy and represents an obstacle to rapid scientific discoveries in this field. Therefore, effectively promoting FAIR (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) access to these data is vital for maximizing the potential of genebanks and driving progress in agricultural innovation. FINDINGS: Here we provide whole genome sequencing data of 812 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plant genetic resources and 298 European elite materials released between 1949 and 2021, as well as the phenotypic data for 4 disease resistance traits and 3 agronomic traits. The robustness of the investigated traits and the interoperability of genomic and phenotypic data were assessed in the current publication, aiming to make this panel publicly available as a resource for future genetic research in barley. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed broad phenotypic variability and high association mapping potential, offering a key resource for identifying genebank donors with untapped genes to advance barley breeding while safeguarding genetic diversity.']",public,['14:giae121'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9270-0036', 'prefLabel': 'Yuan, Zhihui'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3730-9389', 'prefLabel': 'Rembe, Max'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-6013', 'prefLabel': 'Mascher, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-8731', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Nils'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-0946', 'prefLabel': 'Himmelbach, Axel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2951-0541', 'prefLabel': 'Jayakodi, Murukarthick'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Börner, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T2xkYWNoLCBLbGF1cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Oldach, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFob29yLCBBaG1lZCA=', 'prefLabel': 'Jahoor, Ahmed '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmVuc2VuLCBKZW5zIER1ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jensen, Jens Due'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVkbG9mZiwgSnVsaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Rudloff, Julia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9ocmVuZG9yZiwgVmlrdG9yaWEtRWxpc2FiZXRo', 'prefLabel': 'Dohrendorf, Viktoria-Elisabeth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VoZnVzLCBMdWlzYSBQYXVsaW5l', 'prefLabel': 'Kuhfus, Luisa Pauline'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHlyc3prYSwgRW1tYW51ZWxsZSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Dyrszka, Emmanuelle '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29udGUsIE1hdHRoaWV1IA==', 'prefLabel': 'Conte, Matthieu '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlueiwgRnJlZGVyaWsg', 'prefLabel': 'Hinz, Frederik '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHJvdWNoYXVkLCBTYWxpbSAg', 'prefLabel': 'Trouchaud, Salim  '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6742-265X', 'prefLabel': 'Reif, Jochen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1445-9723', 'prefLabel': 'El Hanafi, Samira'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['High-quality phenotypic and genotypic dataset of barley genebank core collection to unlock untapped genetic diversity'],2025-04-11T11:47:18.107+0200,325.0

Molecular breeding of ginseng faces challenges due to its the tetraploid genome and the absence of an efficient molecular marker system. To overcome these obstacles, we adopted genotyping-by-sequencing to delve into genetic mapping and survey genetic diversity. We constructed a comprehensive genetic map comprising 24 linkage groups, each corresponding to one of the 24 chromosomes in the ginseng genome, based on 1216 nonredundant SNPs obtained from an F (2) mapping population. Additionally, 431 103 SNPs were identified from 119 diverse ginseng genotypes. From these, 192 informative subgenome-specific single copy SNPs were selected to develop a SNP chip. The SNP chip was used to genotype a large ginseng collection, encompassing registered cultivars, breeding lines, wild-simulated ginseng, and wild ginseng from various countries and regions. We evaluated the utility of the assay for molecular breeding with 919 ginseng genotypes. This breeder-friendly SNP chip promises versatility, enabling purity assessments of seeds and products, the authentication of species and cultivars, and the determination of homozygosity and homogeneity rates for breeding lines. Genotype data for 1200 ginseng genotypes are now stored in our database.

In previous studies, the recessive BaMMV resistance gene rym15, derived from the Japanese landrace Chikurin Ibaraki 1, was mapped on chromosome 6HS of Hordeum vulgare. In this study, 423 F4 segmental recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from crosses of Chikurin Ibaraki 1 with two BaMMV-susceptible cultivars, Igri (139 RILs) and Uschi (284 RILs). A set of 32 competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays, designed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the barley 50 K Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP chip, genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), was used as a backbone for construction of two high-resolution maps. Using this approach, the target locus was narrowed down to 0.161 cM and 0.036 cM in the Igri x Chikurin Ibaraki 1 (I x C) and Chikurin Ibaraki 1 x Uschi (C x U) populations, respectively. Corresponding physical intervals of 11.3 Mbp and 0.281 Mbp were calculated for I x C and C x U, respectively, according to the Morex v3 genome sequence. In the 0.281 Mbp target region, six high confidence (HC) and two low confidence (LC) genes were identified. Genome assemblies of BaMMV-susceptible cultivars Igri and Golden Promise from the barley pan-genome, and a HiFi assembly of Chikurin Ibaraki 1 together with re-sequencing data for the six HC and two LC genes in susceptible parental cultivar Uschi revealed functional SNPs between resistant and susceptible genotypes only in two of the HC genes.

frl:6510970,"['BACKGROUND: Camelina is an oilseed crop with particularly useful fatty acid and amino acid profiles of its seeds, high resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses, and a short life cycle. Previous genetic engineering approaches in camelina have largely relied on the floral dip method which is, however, associated with genotype-dependent efficiency and incompatibility with methods of direct biomolecule delivery. RESULTS: Here, we established a novel method of transgenesis for camelina, taking advantage of the high regenerative capacity of immature embryos. Various culture conditions and treatments were experimentally validated, which included the duration of explant pre-cultivation, wounding of explants and its time of application, Agrobacterium strain and density of inoculum, acetosyringone concentration, duration of explant-Agrobacterium co-cultivation, as well as application time and concentration of the selective agent hygromycin. We provide convergent evidence of stable transgenicity and transgene inheritance by (1) selection for resistance to hygromycin, (2) PCR, (3) detection of the transgene product GFP, and (4) DNA gel blot analysis involving primary transgenic plants and segregating progeny. Primary transgenics examined in detail featured one to three T-DNA integration loci, with one to seven T-DNA copies being integrated in total per plant. The established method proved efficient across all three tested accessions including two current cultivars, whereby transformation efficiencies, determined as PCR-positive primary transgenic plants related to agro-inoculated explants, of between 13 and 17% were obtained. CONCLUSION: With this method, we provide a viable platform for the functional validation of genes-of-interest and for biotechnological improvements of plant performance and quality features in camelina.']",public,['21(1):35'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8044-6315', 'prefLabel': 'Rezaeva, Barno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T3R0bywgSW5ncmlk', 'prefLabel': 'Otto, Ingrid'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5539-3097', 'prefLabel': 'Hensel, Götz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-4630', 'prefLabel': 'Pouramini, Pouneh'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1633-5388', 'prefLabel': 'Peterson, Anton'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7080-7983', 'prefLabel': 'Kumlehn, Jochen'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Genetic transformation of the oilseed crop camelina using immature zygotic embryos'],2025-04-10T14:33:32.613+0200,325.0

Three-dimensional (3D) image stacks are a source of quantitative data on signal intensity level and distribution and on the type and shape of distribution patterns in space. Their analysis can lead to novel insights that are otherwise missed in qualitative-only analyses. Quantitative image analysis requires specific software and workflows for image rendering, processing, segmentation, setting measurement points and reference frames and exporting target data before further numerical processing and plotting. These tasks often call for the development of customized computational scripts and require an expertise that is not broadly available to the community of experimental biologists. Yet, the increasing accessibility of high- and super-resolution imaging methods fuels the demand for user-friendly image analysis workflows. Here, we provide a compendium of strategies developed by participants of a training school from the COST action INDEPTH to analyze the spatial distribution of nuclear and chromosomal signals from 3D image stacks, acquired by diffraction-limited confocal microscopy and super-resolution microscopy methods (SIM and STED). While the examples make use of one specific commercial software package, the workflows can easily be adapted to concurrent commercial and open-source software. The aim is to encourage biologists lacking custom-script-based expertise to venture into quantitative image analysis and to better exploit the discovery potential of their images.Abbreviations: 3D FISH: three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization; 3D: three-dimensional; ASY1: ASYNAPTIC 1; CC: chromocenters; CO: Crossover; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMC1: DNA MEIOTIC RECOMBINASE 1; DSB: Double-Strand Break; FISH: fluorescence in situ hybridization; GFP: GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; HEI10: HUMAN ENHANCER OF INVASION 10; NCO: Non-Crossover; NE: Nuclear Envelope; Oligo-FISH: oligonucleotide fluorescence in situ hybridization; RNPII: RNA Polymerase II; SC: Synaptonemal Complex; SIM: structured illumination microscopy; ZMM (ZIP: MSH4: MSH5 and MER3 proteins); ZYP1: ZIPPER-LIKE PROTEIN 1.""]",public,['13(1):277-299'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2778-519X', 'prefLabel': 'Randall, Ricardo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3568-580X', 'prefLabel': 'Jourdain, Claire'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5762-3482', 'prefLabel': 'Nowicka, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9259-5942', 'prefLabel': 'Kaduchová, Kateřina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3474-7324', 'prefLabel': 'Kubová, Michaela'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9371-3277', 'prefLabel': 'Ayoub, Mohammad'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3072-0485', 'prefLabel': 'Schubert, Veit'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5215-2338', 'prefLabel': 'TATOUT, Christophe'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6980-9906', 'prefLabel': 'Colas, Isabelle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8026-246X', 'prefLabel': '., Kalyanikrishna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4897-4977', 'prefLabel': 'Desset, Sophie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6839-3224', 'prefLabel': 'MERMET, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm91bGFmbG91cy1TdGV2ZW5zLCBBdXLDqWxpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Boulaflous-Stevens, Aurélia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5673-9715', 'prefLabel': 'Kubalová, Ivona'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6485-0563', 'prefLabel': 'Mandakova, Terezie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0189-8428', 'prefLabel': 'Heckmann, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0318-4194', 'prefLabel': 'Lysak, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8180-8380', 'prefLabel': 'Panatta, Martina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9894-2896', 'prefLabel': 'Santoro, Raffaella'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2390-0733', 'prefLabel': 'Schubert, Daniel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9277-1766', 'prefLabel': 'Pecinka, Ales'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um91dGgsIERldmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Routh, Devin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6307-2229', 'prefLabel': 'Baroux, Célia'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Image analysis workflows to reveal the spatial organization of cell nuclei and chromosomes'],2025-04-17T11:08:27.007+0200,325.0

Here, we uncovered the existence of unconventional single-transmembrane (1TM)-containing ADGRL/Cirl proteins devoid of the conventional GPCR layout (i.e., the 7TM signaling unit) in Drosophila. These 1TM proteins are made as a result of intron retention and provide an N-terminal fragment that acts as an interactor to allow Gαo-dependent signaling through conventional 7TM-containing Cirl isoforms encoded by the same gene. This molecular mechanism determines sensory precision of neurons in response to mechanical stimulation in vivo. This action mode of aGPCR provides a promising entry point for experimental and therapeutic approaches to intervene in aGPCR signaling and implicates alternative splicing as a physiological strategy to express a given aGPCR together with its molecular interactor.

frl:6511074,"[""Introduction The presence of wounds in addition to the excision-induced wounds after severance from the stock plants is known to positively influence adventitious root formation of woody plant cuttings. Previous morphological studies highlighted laser wounding as a technique allowing to precisely control the decisive ablation depth. However, the biochemical processes involved in the response of rooting to the additional wounding remained unexplored.Methods The present study analyzed changes in the plant hormone and carbohydrate profiles in response to laser treatments of rose leafy single-node stem cuttings (Rosa canina 'Pf & auml;nder'). Concentrations of four groups of plant hormones and of carbohydrates were monitored in three different stem sections of the cutting base during the first eight days after excision of cuttings. In addition, histology was employed to investigate anatomical changes at the basal wound and the laser wounds at the start and the end of the experiment after 40 days.Results Laser ablation caused an increase of vascular tissue dimension directly in the laser wound, and increased the quantity and quality of rooting compared to control cuttings. A clear early local rise of jasmonic acid (JA) was detected directly in wounded areas after laser marking, as well as an increase in abscisic acid (ABA) that persisted for the subsequent days. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were relatively high on day zero, but decreased thereafter. Interestingly, higher IAA levels were maintained in the stem section below the axillary bud compared with the opposite section. Laser-treated cuttings presented a clear increase in contents of IAA-amino acid conjugates (IAAGlu and IAAsp) and the oxidation product OxIAA. Differences in concentration of these IAA metabolites were related to the position of the laser wound relative to the axillary bud and leaf. Additionally, laser treatments caused gradually increased levels of the cytokinin N6-isopentenyladenine (iP) in laser-treated zones, and of zeatin riboside specifically when the laser wound was placed on the leaf-bud side. Additional laser wounding reduced starch and sucrose levels in all wounded sections at the end of the evaluation period, independently of the wounding location.Discussion The results of this study indicate that presence of additional injured tissue triggers a complex biochemical adjustment at the base of the cutting responsible of inducing vascular tissue growth and capable of generating a positive response to adventitious root formation.""]",public,['15:1515990'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yYWxlcyBPcmVsbGFuYSwgUmF1bCBKYXZpZXIg', 'prefLabel': 'Morales Orellana, Raul Javier '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF0aCwgVGhvbWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Rath, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHJ1ZWdlLCBVd2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Druege, Uwe'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7511-0779', 'prefLabel': 'Tandron Moya, Yudelsy Antonia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-425X', 'prefLabel': 'von Wirén, Nicolaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lua2VsbWFubiwgVHJhdWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Winkelmann, Traud'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Laser-wound stimulated adventitious root formation of Rosa canina cuttings involves a complex response at plant hormonal and metabolic level'],2025-04-15T11:55:27.948+0200,325.0

A promising approach to improving HIV outcomes in Black populations has been the use of community health workers (CHWs). Evidence shows CHWs trained in motivational interviewing (MI) may further improve outcomes, however little data exists about Black CHWs trained in MI who support Black patients with HIV. While CHWs traditionally help address social determinants of health in nonclinical locations, there is less information on CHWs who provide support in clinical settings, which may result in even greater improvements in HIV outcomes. To examine effects of CHWs trained in MI who provide HIV care in both clinic and community settings, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted in Miami-Dade’s largest public hospital. The Integrated Navigation and Support for Treatment, Adherence, Counseling, and Research intervention is a RCT of 300 Black adults with an unmanaged HIV VL (\u2009> 200 copies/mL). CHWs trained in MI are embedded into HIV clinical care teams and participate in hospital rounds with clinicians treating inpatients. Participants randomized into the CHW intervention arm receive 12 months of CHW-led health education and assistance with health care navigation and social services. The primary outcome is change in HIV viral load suppression at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in medication adherence and social determinants of health. Study enrollment began in 2023 and will be completed by 2027. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2025.

However, it is still unclear to what extent speech-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs) contribute to these techniques. The present study addressed this question by re-analyzing an EEG data set obtained during a selective auditory attention task in which participants focused on one of two competing speakers. Segmenting the EEG based on acoustic edges revealed ERPs with clear P1-N1-P2 complexes and enhanced N1 components elicited by attended streams (N1 effect). Comparisons between ERPs and regression results revealed that temporal response functions were highly similar spatiotemporally to the corresponding ERPs and that stimulus reconstruction accuracies were driven by a consistent enhancement of ERPs including the N1 effect. These observations point to a direct link between ERPs to acoustic edges in speech and the linear modeling techniques. In particular, the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio produced by consistent attention-related enhancements of the N1 component was found to be critical for achieving tracking of selectively attended speech, presumably facilitating the higher-order processing of the selected stream.

frl:6510893,"['In plants, L-serine (Ser) biosynthesis occurs through various pathways and is highly dependent on the atmospheric CO(2) concentration, especially in C(3) species, due to the association of the Glycolate Pathway of Ser Biosynthesis (GPSB) with photorespiration. Characterization of a second plant Ser pathway, the Phosphorylated Pathway of Ser Biosynthesis (PPSB), revealed that it is at the crossroads of carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism. The PPSB comprises three sequential reactions catalysed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), 3-phosphoSer aminotransferase (PSAT) and 3-phosphoSer phosphatase (PSP). PPSB was overexpressed in plants exhibiting two different modes of photosynthesis: Arabidopsis (C(3) metabolism), and maize (C(4) metabolism), under ambient (aCO(2)) and elevated (eCO(2)) CO(2) growth conditions. Overexpression in Arabidopsis of the PGDH1 gene alone or PGDH1, PSAT1 and PSP1 in combination increased the Ser levels but also the essential amino acids threonine (aCO(2)), isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine and methionine (eCO(2)) compared to the wild-type. These increases translated into higher protein levels. Likewise, starch levels were also increased in the PPSB-overexpressing lines. In maize, PPSB-deficient lines were obtained by targeting PSP1 using Cas9 endonuclease. We concluded that the expression of PPSB in maize male gametophyte is required for viable pollen development. Maize lines overexpressing the AtPGDH1 gene only displayed higher protein levels but not starch at both aCO(2) and eCO(2) conditions, this translated into a significant rise in the nitrogen/carbon ratio. These results suggest that metabolic engineering of PPSB in crops could enhance nitrogen content, particularly under upcoming eCO(2) conditions where the activity of GPSB is limited.']",public,['23(1):268-280'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FzYXRlamFkYS1BbmNoZWwsIFJ1YmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Casatejada-Anchel, Ruben'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9ycmVzLU1vbmNobywgQWxlamFuZHJv', 'prefLabel': 'Torres-Moncho, Alejandro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW5vbWFuLCBBcm1hbmQgRA==', 'prefLabel': 'Anoman, Armand D'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5537-8276', 'prefLabel': 'Budhagatapalli, Nagaveni'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UMOpcmV6LUxvcmVuY2VzLCBFc3RlciAg', 'prefLabel': 'Pérez-Lorences, Ester  '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9724-5036', 'prefLabel': 'Alcántara Enguídanos, Andrea'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9zYS1Uw6lsbGV6LCBTYXJh', 'prefLabel': 'Rosa-Téllez, Sara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGUgU291emEsIExlb25hcmRvIFBlcmV6', 'prefLabel': 'de Souza, Leonardo Perez'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7080-7983', 'prefLabel': 'Kumlehn, Jochen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9000-335X', 'prefLabel': 'Fernie, Alisdair'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXXDsW96LUJlcnRvbWV1LCBKZXPDunM=', 'prefLabel': 'Muñoz-Bertomeu, Jesús'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4254-8368', 'prefLabel': 'Ros, Roc'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Metabolic engineering of the serine/glycine network as a means to improve the nitrogen content of crops'],2025-04-07T12:31:46.753+0200,325.0

METHODS: Children from eight European countries from the IDEFICS/I.Family cohort with repeated measurements were included in this study. A linear mixed-effect model was used to model the association of serum 25(OH)D as independent variable and z-scores of inflammatory markers [CRP, cytokines, adipokines, combined inflammation score] as dependent variables, where one level accounts for differences between individuals and the other for changes over age within individuals. RESULTS: A total of 1,582 children were included in the study. In the adjusted model, 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with adiponectin (β\u2009=\u20090.11 [95% CI 0.07; 0.16]) and negatively with the inflammation score (β\u2009=\u2009−\u20090.24 [95% CI −\u20090.40; −\u20090.08]) indicating that the adiponectin z-score increased by 0.11 units and the inflammation score decreased by 0.24 units per 12.5 nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D. In children with overweight or obesity, only a positive association between 25(OH)D and IP-10 was observed while in children with normal weight adiponectin was positively and the inflammation score was negatively associated. Associations of vitamin D with adiponectin and the inflammation score were stronger in girls than in boys and a positive association with TNF-α was observed only in girls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that an increase in vitamin D concentrations may help to regulate inflammatory biomarkers. However, it seems to be no benefit of a better vitamin D status in children with overweight/obesity unless their weight is managed to achieve an improved inflammatory marker status.']",public,['63(8):3047-3060'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-2141', 'prefLabel': 'Wolters, Maike'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2216-6653', 'prefLabel': 'Foraita, Ronja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZW5vLCBMdWlzIEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Moreno, Luis A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9sbsOhciwgRMOpbmVz', 'prefLabel': 'Molnár, Dénes'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVzc28sIFBhb2xh', 'prefLabel': 'Russo, Paola'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9ybmFyaXRpcywgTWljaGFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Tornaritis, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGUgSGVuYXV3LCBTdGVmYWFu', 'prefLabel': 'De Henauw, Stefaan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzc25lciwgTGF1cmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Lissner, Lauren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVpZGViYXVtLCBUb29tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Veidebaum, Toomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2ludGVyLCBUaGVyZXNh', 'prefLabel': 'Winter, Theresa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9658-1855', 'prefLabel': 'Marron, Manuela'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1708-2319', 'prefLabel': 'Nagrani, Rajini'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Longitudinal associations between vitamin D status and biomarkers of inflammation in a pan-European cohort of children and adolescents'],2025-02-12T10:57:02.164+0100,266.0

Luteolin is a dietary flavonoid with potent uric acid-lowering and antioxidant bioactivities. To date, the mechanism by which luteolin alleviates hyperuricemia nephropathy (HN) still needs to be better defined. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of luteolin in a preclinical mouse model and in vitro. Luteolin was administered in the HN mice induced by the combination of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine to evaluate the potential renoprotective effects in vivo. The NRK-52E cells were stimulated with adenosine for in vitro evaluation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, biochemical analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were performed for the histopathologic and mechanistic investigations. The results suggest that luteolin attenuated tubular dilation and epithelial atrophy in the renal tissue of HN mice. Further, luteolin improved biochemical indicators concerning renal functions and oxidative stress in vivo. Mechanistically, luteolin reduced the renal expressions of KIM-1 and caspase-3. Luteolin activated renal SIRT1/6 cascade and its downstream Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, luteolin elevated the renal expressions of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G isoform 2 protein (ABCG2) and organic anion/cation transporters. In addition, livers of luteolin-treated HN mice exhibited robust inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Together, our study shows that luteolin alleviates renal injury in the HN mice by activating urate excretion and Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 antioxidant pathways and inhibiting liver xanthine oxidase activity. Thus, luteolin may be a potential agent for the treatment of HN.']",public,['12(10):8053-8066'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2936-5778', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Huifan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIExpbnNoZW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Linsheng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VpLCBMaWxp', 'prefLabel': 'Gui, Lili'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFpoZW5na3Vu', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Zhengkun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVvLCBIYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Luo, Han'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIE1hbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Mao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Yan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWlhbiwgWW9uZ3NodWFp', 'prefLabel': 'Qian, Yongshuai'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FvLCBXZW5qaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Cao, Wenjie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBMaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Li'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2016-6422', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Fei'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Luteolin ameliorates hyperuricemic nephropathy by activating urate excretion and Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 antioxidant pathways in mice'],2025-03-19T11:56:18.381+0100,286.0
frl:6525215,"['BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Heart transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage heart failure, yet it involves significant psychological and emotional challenges throughout its various stages. International guidelines recommend a multi-professional approach to the care of these patients and a psycho-social assessment for listing. The recommendations focus on content aspects, but not on the psychometric measure to be administered to patients as part of the assessment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide the preliminary results of administering the protocol used by our center, measuring coping strategies, cognitive functioning, quality of life, and psychological distress in a sample of patients who are candidates for and undergo cardiac transplantation, and to observe any variations after the procedure. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive psychological-clinical assessment involving 40 patients, focusing on psychosocial functioning, cognitive reserves, mental health, and coping strategies. Tools such as the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) were employed to evaluate readiness for transplantation and post-transplant adaptation. RESULTS: Results showed high levels of clinical anxiety (52.5%) and low perceived physical health (98%) before the transplant, while post-operative evaluations indicated reduced anxiety (13.51%) and depressive symptoms (10.81%), along with improved psychological well-being and reintegration into daily life. CONCLUSIONS: These results show improvement in physical and cognitive levels, accompanied by a state of enhanced psychological well-being after transplantation. A longitudinal psychological approach, from pre-transplant screening to post-discharge follow-up, is needed to address distress, improve coping mechanisms, and promote treatment adherence. This integrative strategy is critical to improving the quality of life and long-term outcomes for heart transplant recipients.']",public,['6(3):22'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9583-1581', 'prefLabel': 'Giovannico, Lorenzo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFkaXNhLFZhbGVyaWEg', 'prefLabel': 'Ladisa,Valeria '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGUgU2FudGlzLCBTaW1vbmEg', 'prefLabel': 'De Santis, Simona '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-8804-8013', 'prefLabel': 'Fischetti, Giuseppe '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFyaWdpbm8sIERvbWVuaWNvIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Parigino, Domenico '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/IFNhdmlubywgTHVjYQ==', 'prefLabel': ' Savino, Luca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF6em9uZSwgRmVkZXJpY2Eg', 'prefLabel': 'Mazzone, Federica '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGkgQmFyaSwgTmljb2xhIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Di Bari, Nicola '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7535-9670', 'prefLabel': 'Padalino, Massimo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm90dGlvLCBUb21hc28g', 'prefLabel': 'Bottio, Tomaso '}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Mental Health Support for Heart Transplant Recipients and Candidates: Nurturing Well-Being Beyond Surgery'],2025-07-30T11:07:35.131+0200,355.0
frl:6525169,"[""A history of viral infection has been associated with a higher risk for psychiatric disorders. One potential underlying mechanism is that antiviral immunological responses could trigger cross-reactivity between viral and neural antigens, which would raise the co-occurrence of antiviral antibodies and anti-neural autoantibodies. We studied 619 patients' psychiatric diagnoses from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Göttingen, Germany. Anti-neural autoantibodies and antiviral antibody specific indices were measured in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all patients. Among these 619 patients, 115 tested positive for serum and/or CSF neural autoantibodies (18.6%), with the most often identified autoantibodies being anti-GAD65 in serum (2.2%) and CSF (1.6%), and anti-NMDA in serum (0.6%) and CSF (1.3%). The three main diagnostic groups presenting neural autoantibodies were patients with organic psychiatric disorders including dementia (81 of 377; 21.7%), those with psychotic disorders (9 of 66; 13.6%), and patients with affective disorders (19 of 138; 13.9%). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between the varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody-specific index and autoantibody positivity in patients with all diagnoses (F00-F79) (p < 0.005). Furthermore, the rubella antibody-specific index proved to be significantly associated with neural autoantibody positivity (p < 0.001) across all patients (F00-F79), and in those with affective disorders (p < 0.01). Our results show that VZV and rubella antiviral antibodies are associated with a higher propensity to develop anti-neural autoantibodies, suggesting that the known association between viral infection and later developing psychiatric disorders may be partly attributable to the development of anti-neural autoimmunity.

Zhilong Huoxue Tongyu Capsule (ZL), a traditional Chinese medicine, is extensively employed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, this study aimed to comprehensively explore the mechanism of action of ZL on DCM. METHOD: Network pharmacology approaches were applied to predict the potential pathways and targets of ZL on DCM. Then, a DCM model mouse was constructed and divided into a control group, DCM group, DCM\u2009+\u2009ZL group, SB203580 group, and DCM\u2009+\u2009R group. The DCM\u2009+\u2009ZL group was administered 6.24g/kg/d ZL via gavage, the SB203580 group was given 1\u2009mg/kg/d SB203580 (p38MAPK inhibitor) via intraperitoneal injection, the DCM\u2009+\u2009R group received 4\u2009mg/kg/d rosiglitazone via gavage, and the control group and DCM group were given equal volume of physiological saline by gavage. The intervention period lasted for 6 weeks to verify these key targets. RESULT: Network pharmacology analyses identified 45 active ingredients in ZL linked to 719 potential targets, forming an herbal compound-target network. Screening of databases revealed 1032 DCM-related targets, with MAPK14, TNF, FOS, AKT1, and IL-10 emerging as key hub genes from PPI network analysis. Additionally, enrichment analysis indicated that the candidate targets were enriched in response to the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, in vivo studies in DCM mice demonstrated that ZL significantly mitigated myocardial fibrosis and down-regulated the expression of p-P38MAPK, TNF-α, α-SMA, and Collagen-I proteins in myocardial tissue.

Under such conditions, people might need to convert inedible plant biomass into food to meet their daily nutritional requirements. However, the possibility of converting biomass into food under low-resource conditions has not been thoroughly studied. To address this uncertainty, we evaluated the potential for using resources available in a typical household to extract sugars from willow biomass and meet the carbohydrate needs of an adult. Grinding willow biomass in a household blender for 24\u2009min produced willow particles similar to those produced in a laboratory-scale Wiley mill. Thermal treatments of these particles with hot water extraction, pressure cooking, or microwaving only extracted 0.5%–0.8% (w/w) glucose from the biomass. Household acid or alkali treatments yielded only 0.5% (w/w) glucose. These sugar yields would be insufficient to provide nutrition to an adult. In contrast, enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated willow at 50°C for 72\u2009h yielded 2%–8% (w/w) glucose, and pretreating willow with sodium hydroxide and pressure before enzymatic treatment increased glucose yields to 28% (w/w).

Texture remained largely unaffected initially; however, after 2\u2009weeks of storage, cricket flour significantly decreased the hardness (from 15 to 12\u2009N) and chewiness values (from 1.6 to 1.0\u2009N\u2009mm). Moreover, cricket flour significantly increased the aerobic count (from 3–4 log to 5 log cfu g−1). The sensory space of the cricket samples was separated from the milk protein samples, mainly related to flavor attributes, while the commercial sample was distinguished by dryness and sweetness. In general, carob powder did not affect the measured parameters compared to cocoa. This study demonstrated the suitability of utilizing cricket flour and carob powder in a high-protein snack without substantially compromising the product's organoleptic properties.

Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing reactivatable STED (ReSTED) based on the photophysical properties of the nanographene dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBOV). In contrast to the photo-induced decomposition of other fluorophores, the fluorescence of DBOV is only temporarily deactivated and can be reactivated by near-infrared light (including the 775 nm depletion beam).

Patterns of recombination are highly variable along chromosomes, between sexes, individuals, populations, and species. In many eukaryotes, recombination rates are elevated in sub-telomeric regions and drastically reduced near centromeres, resulting in large low-recombining (LR) regions. The processes of recombination are influenced by genetic factors, such as different alleles of genes involved in meiosis and chromatin structure, as well as external environmental stimuli like temperature and overall stress. In this work, we focused on the genomic landscapes of recombination in a collection of 916 rye (Secale cereale) individuals. By analysing population structure among individuals of different domestication status and geographic origin, we detected high levels of admixture, reflecting the reproductive biology of a self-incompatible, wind-pollinating grass species. We then analysed patterns of recombination in overlapping subpopulations, which revealed substantial variation in the physical size of LR regions, with a tendency for larger LR regions in domesticated subpopulations. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) for LR region size revealed a major quantitative-trait-locus (QTL) at which, among 18 annotated genes, an ortholog of histone H4 acetyltransferase ESA1 was located. Rye individuals belonging to domesticated subpopulations showed increased synaptonemal complex length, but no difference in crossover frequency, indicating that only the recombination landscape is different. Furthermore, the genomic region harbouring rye ScESA1 showed moderate patterns of selection in domesticated subpopulations, suggesting that larger LR regions were indirectly selected for during domestication to achieve more homogeneous populations for agricultural use.']",public,['39(6):msac131'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6771-6914', 'prefLabel': 'Schreiber, Mona'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FvLCBZaXh1YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Gao, Yixuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29jaCwgTmF0YWxpZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Koch, Natalie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4171-5371', 'prefLabel': 'Fuchs, Joerg'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0189-8428', 'prefLabel': 'Heckmann, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-0946', 'prefLabel': 'Himmelbach, Axel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Börner, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/w5Z6a2FuLCBIYWthbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Özkan, Hakan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2916-7475', 'prefLabel': 'Maurer, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-8731', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Nils'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-6013', 'prefLabel': 'Mascher, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4766-9698', 'prefLabel': 'Dreissig, Steven'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Recombination landscape divergence between populations is marked by larger low-recombining regions in domesticated rye'],2025-04-17T12:09:42.047+0200,325.0

Behavioral assays and in vivo wide-field Ca2+ imaging revealed that recognition memory, learning flexibility, and slow-wave impairment were all improved following the 15-day pitolisant treatment. Improved recognition memory was tightly correlated with slow-wave coherence, suggesting slow waves serve as a biomarker for treatment response and for AD drug screening. Furthermore, pitolisant reduced amyloid-β deposition and dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques, and enhanced neuronal lysosomal activity, inhibiting which blocked cognitive and slow-wave restoration.

To overcome the hostile environment elicited by the macrophage, MAP secretes a battery of virulence factors to neutralize the toxic effects of the macrophage. One of the virulence factors is the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase A (PtpA), a protein secreted by MAP that interferes in the phago-lysosome fusion, rendering the pathogen unnoticed in the cytoplasm of the macrophage. This study aimed to assess the presence of PtpA antibodies in the sera of Mexican individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and investigate its possible use as a biomarker for disease activity. We compared RA patients (n = 100) to control subjects (CS) (n = 100) by assessing specific immune responses to PtpA (the antigen) by an indirect ELISA method. Results showed a significant difference in PtpA levels between RA and CS, with RA patients having a median OD of 0.4645 compared to 0.1372 in CS. Antibodies against PtpA were present in 95% of RA patients and 16% of CS (AUC = 0.9163, p = 0.0001). Male control subjects showed higher PtpA reactivity than female CS.

Given multiple biomarkers, there is a practical choice of whether to estimate the joint distribution of all biomarkers in a single model or to model the univariate marginal distribution of each marker separately ignoring the covariance structure among measures. To fully utilize all trajectory-relevant information in multiple longitudinal markers, a joint model is required, but its complexity and computational burden may only be warranted when joint estimates of trajectories are substantially more efficient than separate estimates. This paper derives general expressions for the inefficiency of univariate or “separated"" estimates of population-average trajectories and individual’s random effects as compared to the fully efficient multivariate or “combined"" estimates. Then, in two settings: (1) a general bivariate case; and (2) our motivating clinical case study with 5 measures, we find that separated estimates of fixed effects are nearly fully efficient. However, joint estimates of random effects can be meaningfully more efficient for measures with substantial missing data when other strongly correlated measures are observed more frequently. This increased efficiency of the joint model derives more from joint shrinkage of random effects in multivariate space than from improved estimates of the subject-specific trajectories obtained when accounting for correlations in measurements.

As a tissue resident cell, mast cells are crucial in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Vitamin A is an important fat-soluble vitamin with immunomodulatory functions. Vitamin A deficiency has been shown to be associated with allergic disease states, including asthma; however, no studies have been reported on whether vitamin A deficiency has an effect on the activation of mast cells in allergic reactions. ObjectiveTo explore whether blocking retinoic acid receptors has an effect on mast cell degranulation. Methods Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of FCεRIα and CD117 on the cell surface, toluidine blue staining was used to visualize cellular features and morphological changes. ELISA was used to detect histamine release. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of relevant signaling pathways and cytokine genes. Western blot was used to detect the expression of relevant signaling pathway proteins. ResultsIn the present study, we found that antagonism of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) resulted in overactive mast cells and increased their degranulation. Furthermore, inflammatory signaling pathways such as MyD88-IKK-NF-κB and PI3K-Akt-m-TOR were involved in the effect of retinoic acid (RA) on the activation state of mast cells.

There are many statistical methods for estimating genotype x environment interaction, among which AMMI and GGE-biplot analyses provide better and more interpretable results. The objective of this study was to assess the genotype x environment interaction, as well as the adaptability and stability of 40 quinoa genotypes. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in eight environments (four locations of Iran and two years). The AMMI analysis of variance showed that the main effects of genotype and environment, as well as the interaction effect of genotype x environment were significant on grain yield. Separation of genotype x environment interaction based on the principal component method showed that the first six principal components were significant and accounted for 47.6%, 22.5%, 9%, 7%, 6% and 4.3% of the genotype x environment interaction variance, respectively. Based on the AMMI model, genotypes G16, G19, G35, G30, G39, G24, and G18 were identified as high-yielding and stable genotypes with high general adaptability. In contrast, genotypes G36, G27, G38, G9, G28, G29, G23, G34, G13, and G12 were the most unstable genotypes in the studied environments. In GGE-biplot analysis, two mega-environments were identified, and genotypes G16, G19, G25, and G17 were also identified as high-yielding and stable genotypes for these environments. Also, based on the biplot diagram of the ideal genotype, genotypes G16, G19, G17, and G35 were the nearest genotypes to the ideal genotype. In total, the results of various analyses showed that the three genotypes G16 and G19 were the superior genotypes of this experiment in terms of grain yield and stability. These genotypes can be introduced as high-yielding and stable genotypes to the climatic conditions of the studied areas.']",public,['15:1487106'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5284-7970', 'prefLabel': 'Jokarfard, vahid'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5432-4498', 'prefLabel': 'Rabiei, Babak'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1866-262X', 'prefLabel': 'sourilaki, Ebrahim'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Börner, Andreas'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Stability and adaptability of grain yield in quinoa genotypes in four locations of Iran'],2025-04-14T14:20:02.327+0200,325.0

Hepatic cells buildup with more fat molecules when a person takes high fat diet that is excessive than the body can handle. At present, millions of people in the world are affected by this problem. So, it is very important to know the effects of factors responsible for the disease. Here, the role of lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and metabolism was analyzed and intended to investigate if defects in biogenesis/metabolic enzymes are responsible for the accumulation of lipids other than LDs in fatty liver disease in high-fat-induced conditions in mice model. To explore it, high-fat diet (HFD), fast food (FF), and soft drinks (SD) were administered to wild-type Swiss albino mice for 14\u2009weeks following yogurt supplementation. After experimental period, glucose tolerance, enzyme function, lipid profile, plasma biochemistry, and other analytical tests were analyzed by auto-analyzer including different oxidative stress markers. Lipids from hepatic tissues were extracted, and purified by Floatation Assay and subsequently analyzed by different biochemical and chromatographic techniques. Histological architecture of hepatocytes was performed using Zeiss microscope. Finally, increased amount of lipids biogenesis/accumulation was found in liver tissues that causes Fatty liver disease. Significantly, HFD, FF, and SD were identified as factors for the increased LD biogenesis and or lipid metabolic disorder. Nevertheless, yogurt supplementation can homeostasis those LD formation and metabolic syndrome as it increases the down regulation of lipid biogenesis as well as lipid metabolic rate. So, yogurt supplementation was considered as a novel agent for decreasing LD biogenesis as well as excessive accumulation of fat in hepatocytes which can be used as therapeutics for the treatment of NAFLD.']",public,['13(1):e4650'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzYW4sIFNvaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Hasan, Sohel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1pbiwgQW1pbnVsIElzbGFt', 'prefLabel': 'Amin, Aminul Islam'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWlhLCBNYXN1bQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mia, Masum'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhdHVuLCBTdW1haXlh', 'prefLabel': 'Khatun, Sumaiya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXJhZmF0LCBZZXNpcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Arafat, Yesir'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29mdXIsIFJveWhhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Gofur, Royhan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXNsYW0sIE1haG11ZHVs', 'prefLabel': 'Islam, Mahmudul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9zZW4sIEVyYW0=', 'prefLabel': 'Hosen, Eram'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxtYWFyeSwgS2hhbGlkIFMu', 'prefLabel': 'Almaary, Khalid S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmVudGFodW4gV29uZG1pZSwgR2V6YWhpZ24=', 'prefLabel': 'Fentahun Wondmie, Gezahign'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXNsYW0sIEFtaXJ1bA==', 'prefLabel': 'Islam, Amirul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFobWFuLCBNYXRpYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Rahman, Matiar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3707-8461', 'prefLabel': 'bourhia, mohammed'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Yogurt Supplementation Can Ameliorate Fatty Liver Diseases and Metabolic Syndrome in High Fat-Induced Conditions in Mice'],2025-06-26T12:49:34.561+0200,286.0

However, the exact cause or pathogenesis of the concurrent manifestations of these two conditions in the same individuals remains uncertain. This research aimed to scrutinize the important molecules and mechanisms responsible for the concomitance of Crohn’s disease and Psoriasis by using quantitative bioinformatics utilizing a publicly available RNA sequencing repository.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe database Gene Expression Omnibus were assessed, specifically for Crohn’s disease (GSE95095) and psoriasis (GSE13355). The ‘limma’ library of the R programming syntax is employed to identify differentially expressed genes. The Search Tool for Interacting Genes dataset was utilized to study the interaction between proteins networks. The Cytoscape software was utilized to efficiently view and analyse these Protein-Protein Interaction networks. The ctoHubba Cytoscape plugin helps in the selection of hub genes. These hub genes have been confirmed using data from GSE102133 for Crohn’s disease and GSE14905 for psoriasis. The ROC curves were utilized in this study to assess the diagnostic value of the hub genes. Moreover, new research involving gene-set enriched studies and the study of immunological surveillance associated with these specific genes is attainable.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the identified common DEGs, 40 genes were downregulated and 37 were upregulated, totaling 77 genes. Crohn’s disease and Psoriasis had a higher concentration of pathways associated with inflammation. After validation, functionality of hub genes was confirmed for S100A12, CXCL8, IL1RN, S100A9, CXCL10, MMP1, CXCL1, FPR1, CXCR2, and S100A8. The hub genes showed an increase in expression in response to neutrophil infiltration. The expression of S100A12, CXCL8, IL1RN, S100A9, CXCL10, MMP1, CXCL1, FPR1, CXCR2, and S100A8 was found to be significantly linked to immune processes such as neutrophil activation, neutrophil chemotaxis, and neutrophil migration associated with Crohn’s and Psoriasis disease.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThis bioinformatics study has elucidated S100A12, CXCL8, IL1RN, S100A9, CXCL10, MMP1, CXCL1, FPR1, CXCR2, and S100A8 as the central genes in the pathogenesis of CD and Psoriasis comorbidity.

It is structurally similar to cholesterol, except for the addition of the ethyl group. The primary benefit of β-sitosterol is that it lowers the body's absorption of low-density lipoprotein, or “bad” cholesterol. Research efforts to date and information from the available literature have demonstrated that β-sitosterol has many pharmacological benefits to improve human health; it effectively prevents heart diseases, cancer, and diabetes. To date, many investigations on β-sitosterol have been conducted in in vitro and in vivo studies.

We recorded 46 ground-dwelling mammals and birds, including several threatened Annamite endemics. Using multi-species Royle-Nichols model and landscape covariates, we found higher richness in broadleaf evergreen forest located in more remote and less rugged areas. We then used species responses to covariates to predict species distribution and identify high-priority areas for conservation. Furthermore, we constructed diversity profiles that indicated higher biodiversity in broadleaf evergreen forest compared to the coniferous forest. Finally, we used a dissimilarity index to assess the level of defaunation, revealing 16% of the community had been lost, with higher levels of defaunation for threatened and larger-sized species. Our findings provide insights into the status, distribution, and occurrence of the ground-dwelling mammal and bird communities in the Langbian Plateau, and can help stakeholders design more effective conservation strategies to protect existing populations.']",public,['6(4):e13093'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-2861-2672', 'prefLabel': 'Nguyen, An'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGlsa2VyLCBBbmRyZXc=', 'prefLabel': 'Tilker, Andrew'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGUsIER1eQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Le, Duy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmllZGJhbGxhLCBKw7xyZ2Vu', 'prefLabel': 'Niedballa, Jürgen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGZsdW1tLCBMdWlzYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Pflumm, Luisa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGhhbSwgWHVhbiBIb2Fu', 'prefLabel': 'Pham, Xuan Hoan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGUsIFZhbiBTb24=', 'prefLabel': 'Le, Van Son'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THV1LCBIb25nIFRydW9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Luu, Hong Truong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHJhbiwgVmFuIEJhbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Tran, Van Bang'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9269-4446', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sbG1hbm4sIFJhaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Sollmann, Rahel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5073-9186', 'prefLabel': 'Wilting, Andreas'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Ground‐dwelling mammal and bird diversity in the southern Annamites: Exploring complex habitat associations and the ghost of past hunting pressure'],2025-06-12T07:37:22.889+0200,336.0

Many studies have suggested that plants belonging to this genus possess strong cardio-protective potentials. Rats were pre-treated with crude methanolic extract and other fractions at a dose of 500\u2009mg/kg followed by administration of Isoproterenol hydrochloride after 24\u2009h for 2\u2009days. The cardioprotective effect was determined by investigating the levels of Biomarkers responsible for myocardial infarction (MI). Among all fractions Pp.CF (chloroform fraction) exhibited a significant cardioprotective effect by decreasing the levels of ALT, AST, CPK, and LDH to 74.56\u2009±\u20091.45, 95.78\u2009±\u20092.75, 156.73\u2009±\u20091.84, and 215.55\u2009±\u20095.33\u2009IU/L in serum. The same fraction was tested for cardio-protective potential at a dose of 50, 100, and 250\u2009mg/kg. Pp.CF at a dose of 250\u2009mg/kg exhibited prominent effects and reduced levels of biomarkers responsible for MI. Further investigations confirmed that Pp.CF possesses antihyperlipidemic, membrane stabilizing, and thrombolytic potential which suggests P. plebeium an ideal candidate for natural product isolation which will be helpful in the management of cardiovascular problems.']",public,['13(1):e4750'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWJyYXIsIE11aGFtbWFk', 'prefLabel': 'Ibrar, Muhammad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbiwgTWlyIEF6YW0=', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Mir Azam'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-0616', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Dr. Abdullah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbiwgTXVoYW1tYWQgQXNnaGFy', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Muhammad Asghar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFuLCBNdWhhbW1hZCBTYWVlZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Jan, Muhammad Saeed'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF1ZiwgQWJkdXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Rauf, Abdur'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3662-0933', 'prefLabel': 'Khalil, Anees Ahmed'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4674-9378', 'prefLabel': 'Khalid, Ahood'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhaGlkLCBTYW1pYWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Shahid, Samiah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8452-5343', 'prefLabel': 'Quradha, Mohammed Mansour'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['An Insight Into the Phytochemical Composition, Cardioprotective, and Antioxidant Characteristics of Small Knotweed (Polygonum plebeium R.

frl:6526181,"[""In the Rutaceae family Citrus maxima is the biggest among all fruits, tradtionally used for several purposes due to its diverse ethnomedicinal, phytochemical, and pharmacological activities. Different portions of this plant have been used as sedatives and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as to treat coughs, fevers, asthma, diarrhea, ulcers, and diabetes. There is a scientific potential for the methanolic seed extract to contain bioactive compounds, similar to those found in other parts of the plant. The extract derived from the seeds has already demonstrated potential biological activity. Moreover, there weren't many in vivo and in vitro research works on these plants' seeds. Therefore, the current research work was undertaken to analyze anti-diarrheal and antipyretic potentials of the methanolic extract of Citrus maxima seeds (MCM). To evaluate MCM's effectiveness in treating diarrhea, castor oil-induced diarrhea model was utilized as an evaluating method. The antipyretic effect in mice was measured using brewer's yeast induced pyrexia model. The MCM at 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg doses markedly reduced hyperpyrexia, induced by yeast. The effect remained persistent up to 4th hour after administration. In the castor oil induced diarrhea model, the methanolic seed extract showed high level of dose dependent inhibition of diarrhea for 4\u2009h following castor oil administration. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate and clarify the specific causative agents responsible for the dose-dependent effects observed. The findings of the present study suggest that MCM seed extract may represent a promising alternative for the development of innovative anti-diarrheal and anti-pyretic compounds.""]",public,['13(1):e4631'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5726-2840', 'prefLabel': 'Maria, Nazratun Noor'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFzbWluLCBBeWVzaGEgQWt0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Jasmin, Ayesha Akter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFobWlkYSwgVW1tZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Tahmida, Umme'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6472-046X', 'prefLabel': 'Singha, Saurav'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWhzYW4sIFRhbnZlZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Ahsan, Tanveer'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Investigation on Anti-Diarrheal and Antipyretic Activities of citrus maxima Seeds in Swiss Albino Mice Model'],2025-09-11T12:14:43.184+0200,286.0

frl:6510829,"['Birds have an excellent visual system, which they depend on in many life situations such as finding food or mating partners. The retina in the eye contains photoreceptors, which can be subdivided into cones and rods active at either high or low light intensities. Among other species, birds have the highest diversity of cones, because in addition to red, green and blue-sensitive cones, also found in the human retina, they can also sense ultraviolet light and possess a so-called double cone, which consists of two subunits and whose function is still unclear. However, how does the eye extract information such as colour, high-resolution details or our own movement from these light signals? To answer this question, we need to understand how the information from the individual photoreceptors is processed within the retina before it is transmitted to the brain.The aim of this project was to provide deeper insights into the neuronal connectivity in the avian retina and to reveal species-specific but also regional differences (central vs peripheral retina). The European robin has a fovea (site of sharpest vision) and therefore offers the opportunity to gain insights into the signal transmission of all the above-mentioned information. Using a multi-beam scanning electron microscope, we were able to generate two high-resolution (nanometre scale) data sets of the European robin retina located in two different regions enabling us to analyse the connectivity of various retinal neurons. A comparison with previous results from the chicken identified for example a high similarity between bipolar cell types but substantial differences in their individual connectivity to cones, which might reflect an adaptation to their different lifestyles. The majority of these bipolar cell types but also half of the analysed horizontal cell types predominantly contacted double cones, sometimes even highly selective only one of its subunits. A comparison with already functionally characterized retinas such as the turtle retina might lead to the speculation that double cones are responsible for the transmission of non-colour-specific information such as movement or highly detailed information whereas colour vision is processed through the individual single cones.The results of this project provide important insights into visual information processing in the avian retina and a comprehensive comparison with other vertebrates will provide important insights into evolutionary developments of the retina. Detailed functional analysis of the avian retina are urgently needed to link the identified circuits to specific visual information and also to further characterize the role of double cones in the retina.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Günther, Anja', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1361982896'}, {'prefLabel': 'Briggman, Kevin', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1171266588'}, {'prefLabel': 'Max-Planck-Institut für Neurobiologie des Verhaltens - caesar', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1254064885'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2007744-0'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'label': 'Englisch', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Retinal circuitry in the European robin'],2025-04-01T08:33:02.353+0200,338.0

frl:6510615,"['Die Ergebnisse der neunten Welle untermauern einmal mehr, dass Sportvereine in Deutschland nicht nur zentrale Institutionen für Sport und Bewegung sind, sondern auch eine wesentliche gesellschaftliche Funktion als Orte sozialer Interaktion und gemeinschaftlichen Zusammenhalts darstellen. In den letzten Jahren ist ein verstärktes Selbstverständnis der Vereine als Solidargemeinschaften zu beobachten und die Vereine legen verstärkt Wert auf ein Gemeinschaftsgefühl. Blickt man auf die Ressourcensituation der Vereine, so zeigt sich, dass das ehrenamtliche Engagement die zentrale Herausforderung bleibt. Die Bindung und Gewinnung von ehrenamtlichen FunktionsträgerInnen stellen 17,5 % der Vereine vor existenzielle Herausforderungen. Besonders problematisch ist der Rückgang junger Engagierter.

Autosuggestion and mental imagery are two candidate processes for such a modulation, however, their precise effects on social emotion perception remain uncertain. Here, we investigated how autosuggestion and mental imagery, employed during an adaptation period, influence the subsequent perception of facial emotions, and to which extent. Separate cohorts of participants took part in five experiments, where they either mentally affirmed (autosuggested; Experiments 1a and 1b) or imagined (Experiment 2) that a neutral face would be expressing a specific emotion (happy or sad). Subsequent facial emotion perception was then assessed by calculating points of subjective equality (PSEs) along a happiness-sadness continuum. Our results show that both autosuggestion and mental imagery induce a bias towards perceiving facial emotions in the direction of the desired emotion, with larger Bayes factors supporting autosuggestion. Experiment 3 confirmed the absence of effects when emotional words were presented together with a neutral face, suggesting a limited role of response bias in driving this effect. Finally, experiment 4 validated the experimental setup by demonstrating standard contrastive aftereffects when participants were adapted to actual, physical emotional faces. Together, our findings provide an initial step towards understanding the potential of intentional cognitive processes to modulate social emotions, specifically by biasing emotional face perception. With comparable effect sizes observed for both autosuggestion and mental imagery, both strategies show promise for self-directed interventions. Their practical applicability may vary due to individual responses, preferred cognitive strategies, and potential overlaps in underlying cognitive mechanisms.

The mesolimbic dopamine system, plays a critical role in these processes. Evidence from human imaging studies and animal models suggests that disruptions in D2R signaling are linked to motivational impairments. For instance, stress models like chronic social defeat (CSD) in mice demonstrate that D2R dysfunction in the ventral striatum can lead to reward-seeking impairments and other depression-like symptoms. Additionally, disturbances in glucose metabolism appear to interact with D2R dysfunction, exacerbating motivational deficits. Research indicates that chronic stress induces hyperglycemia both peripherally and centrally, including the ventral striatum, which may disrupt the effort-reward balance.In conclusion, striatal D2R signaling may be important for effort-based motivation by directly influencing the mesolimbic dopamine system and glucose metabolism.

However, the interaction of these mediators, the exact cause, and the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) are still unclear. Moreover, the interaction of interleukin (IL)-33, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) with other factors in the pathogenesis of KOA has not been elaborately explored. METHOD: Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the expression of IL-33, PDGF-BB, and MMP-9 in the knee cartilage tissue of model mice, murine KOA was induced by using the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation control group, the expression levels of PDGF-BB, IL-33, and MMP-9 were increased significantly, and the pathological sections showed obvious cartilage damage. Additionally, we assessed the levels of IL-33 and MMP-9 expression in the knee joint of KOA model mice following intervention with PDGF-BB antibody, and we found that the expression level of MMP-9 was reduced following intervention with IL-33 antibody. When the effects of the three antibodies were compared in a mouse disease model, it was discovered that the IL-33 antibody could dramatically lower the relative expression level of MMP-9, resulting in the least amount of cartilage damage and improved protection. In conclusion, inhibiting IL-33 can significantly lower inflammatory factor levels in the knee joint, including IL-33 and MMP-9, and it can improve cartilage breakdown in osteoarthritis of the knee. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results indicate that IL-33 has a therapeutic function in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis and may be a novel target for treatment of the underlying causes of KOA. Additionally, PDGF-BB might be an upstream pathway of IL-33, and KOA’s MMP-9 is an downstream pathway of IL-33.\r\n']",public,['19(8):e0301199'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIEZhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Fan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFNpeXVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Siyuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmh1YW5nLCBSdWppZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhuang, Rujie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIENodWFueGlhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Chuanxiao'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-6650-0620', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Kangxiang'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Blocking IL-33 decelerates cartilage degeneration in knee osteoarthritis through mice model'],2025-03-06T14:09:11.304+0100,337.0

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) may substitute some lost function; however, there is a lack of BCI research in people with MS. Present BCI designs have also overlooked the unique pathological changes associated with MS and have not considered needs of users within their home environments. To progress this research area effectively and efficiently, we aimed to evaluate user needs and assess the feasibility and user-centric requirements of a BCI for people with MS. We hypothesised that (i) people with MS would be interested in adopting BCI technology and (ii) those with reduced independence would prefer a higher-performing invasive BCI. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of people with MS to describe user preferences and establish the initial steps of user-centred design. The survey aimed to understand their interest in BCI applications, bionic applications, device preferences, and development considerations and related these to symptoms and assistance needs. RESULTS: We demonstrated widespread interest for BCI applications in all stages of MS, with a preference for a non-invasive (n = 12) or minimally invasive (n = 15) BCI over carer assistance (n = 6). Descriptive analysis indicated that level of independence did not influence preference towards the higher performing but highly invasive BCI. CONCLUSIONS: The needs of end users reported in this study are crucial for efficient development of BCI systems that can be effectively translated into the home environment. Considering the potential to enhance independence and quality of life for people living with MS, the results emphasise the importance of user-centred design for future advancement of BCIs that account for the unique pathological changes associated with MS.\r\n']",public,['20(3):e0319811'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3010-8541', 'prefLabel': 'Russo, John'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2147-7698', 'prefLabel': 'Mahoney, Tim'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9003-6917', 'prefLabel': 'Kokorin, Kirill'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmV5bm9sZHMsIEFzaGxleQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Reynolds, Ashley'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2156-1830', 'prefLabel': 'Lin, Chin-Hsuan Sophie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Sm9obiwgU2FtIEUu', 'prefLabel': 'John, Sam E.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5497-7234', 'prefLabel': 'Grayden, David'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Towards developing brain-computer interfaces for people with Multiple Sclerosis'],2025-03-19T13:47:29.257+0100,337.0

Understanding the prognostic factors for the serious ADRs play a vital role in developing appropriate serious ADR prevention strategies. This study aimed to analyze nationwide database in Thailand to identify predisposing factors associated with the serious ADRs, explore drug exposure, distribution of serious ADRs, types of ADRs, and classify the determinants of serious ADR due to anti-infective in Thailand. The national database of anti-infective-induced ADRs from January 2012 to December 2021 in Thailand’s 77 provinces, Thai Vigibase at the Health Product Vigilance Center (HPVC), was considered. After pre-processing, frequencies and percentages were used to investigate the distribution of ADR seriousness. To determine the significance of the independent variables on the seriousness of anti-infective-induced ADRs, logistic regression and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model were performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 82,333 ADR cases, of which 20,692 were serious ADRs (25.13%). Serious ADRs is statistically associated with region, gender, ethnicity, age, type of patient, history of drug allergy, chronic disease and dose frequency (p-value < 0.001). The most commonly reported serious ADRs were in the South region of Thailand (OR\u2009=\u20091.92, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.88–1.97), followed by the North region (OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI\u2009= 1.64–1.71) of Thailand. Gender and history of drug allergy were also statistically associated with the seriousness of ADRs (p-value = 0.001). Reported ADRs revealed that patients were males (OR =\u2009 1.11, 95% CI = 1.11–1.13) and those with a prior history of drug allergy (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.20–1.24) were more likely to experience serious ADRs. The risk of having an ADR reported as serious was significantly higher in patients aged 60 and over (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.39–1.46) and patients aged 40–59 years (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.31–1.37) compared to patients aged 0–19 years. IPD patients most commonly associated with serious ADRs. The results of this study will enable healthcare professionals to use caution when prescribing to those groups. Furthermore, developing a reporting system to reduce serious ADR evidence, such as software with electronic prescribing databases or applications that enable efficient detection of ADRs in high-risk groups, was critical in order to closely monitor and improve patient safety.']",public,['20(2):e0318597'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2l0dGlwaGFuLCBTb3BpdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Sittiphan, Sopit'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7137-4101', 'prefLabel': 'Lim, Apiradee'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1814-4742', 'prefLabel': 'Khurram, Haris'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHVyZWgsIE51cmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Dureh, Nurin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGl0dGFrYW4sIEt3YW5rYW1vbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Dittakan, Kwankamon'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Epidemiology of reported serious adverse drug reactions due to anti-infectives using nationwide database of Thailand'],2025-03-14T11:35:13.166+0100,337.0

Vitamin D has been identified as contributing environmental risk factor, with higher prevalence at latitudes further from the equator. Mongolia, at 45°N, has limited sunlight exposure, increasing the population’s risk for vitamin D deficiency. OBJECTIVES: To compare vitamin D levels between persons with MS (pwMS) and persons without MS and to identify factors associated with low vitamin D. METHODS: We investigated associations with vitamin D levels using data from MS cases and controls from Mongolia. We used linear mixed-effects regression with fixed effects (case status, sociodemographics, and predefined variables) and participant-specific random intercepts. RESULTS: Of 62 participants (31 pwMS, 31 controls), pwMS had lower summer [median 23.00 ng/ml (interquartile range 11.30–31.50) vs. 25.00 ng/ml (19.25–32.00)] and winter vitamin D levels [21.00 ng/ml (10.60–27.60) vs. 23.50 ng/ml (15.55–28.60)], with a smaller seasonal decline. Vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in pwMS. None of these findings reached statistical significance. Winter season and being breastfed as a child were associated with significantly lower vitamin D levels. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was common among pwMS, which could be influenced by behavioural factors. These findings may inform more targeted recommendations for pwMS to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0317279'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFhbGtob3JvbCwgTXlhZGFnbWFh', 'prefLabel': 'Jaalkhorol, Myadagmaa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFzaHRzZXJlbiwgQW1hcnNhaWtoYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Dashtseren, Amarsaikhan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFnbmFpYmF5YXIsIEdhbnR1eWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Magnaibayar, Gantuya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmF0LU9yZ2lsLCBCYWRyYW5ndWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Bat-Orgil, Badrangui'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1798-714X', 'prefLabel': 'Tsunoda, Ikuo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXZpcm1lZCwgU2hpaXJldm55YW1iYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Avirmed, Shiirevnyamba'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5808-9026', 'prefLabel': 'Iaquinto, Stefania'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8754-9797', 'prefLabel': 'von Wyl, Viktor'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Factors associated with vitamin D levels in Mongolian patients with multiple sclerosis'],2025-03-20T13:28:21.545+0100,337.0

To date, there has been no effective vaccine candidate available for echinococcosis. Therefore, we employed computational approaches to develop a multiepitope-based vaccine using the most potent epitopes of MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell derived from the Ag5 protein of Echinococcus spp. The final vaccine construct containing the epitopes, linkers, and adjuvant exhibited potent antigenicity (score > 0.1) with no evidence of allergenicity (score < 0) and toxicity (score < 0) in several computational platforms. The vaccine also exhibited favorable physicochemical characteristics such as being highly soluble (SOLpro score of 0.781243) and hydrophilic (Grand average of hydropathy of -0.433). Moreover, the tertiary structure of the vaccine was also found to be structurally stable, with a Z score of -5.71. Further, the molecular docking analysis confirmed the vaccine’s significant binding affinity to the RP-105 (docking score of -1252.7) and TLR-9 (docking score of -970.9). The molecular dynamic simulations confirmed the structural stability of the docked complexes under a virtual physiological system. The negative ΔTOTAL values derived from the MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA analyses confirmed a spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable binding process between the vaccine and receptors. Moreover, the vaccine demonstrated high potentiality to elicit both innate (natural killer cell, dendritic and macrophage) and adaptive (B-cell, helper T cell and cytotoxic T cell) immune responses with sustained humoral immune responses evidenced by increased IFN-γ and IL-2 levels. Following codon optimization and in silico cloning, the vaccine was successfully expressed (CAI value of 0.9607 and average GC content of 52.34%) after being inserted into the pET-28a (+) plasmid of E. coli.

Recently, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has taken center stage in the currently ongoing revolution that is changing standard-of-care treatment for several malignancies, including MPM. As multiple arguments and accumulating lines of evidence are in support of the existence of a therapeutic synergism between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as between different classes of immunotherapeutics, we designed a multicenter, single-arm, phase I/II trial in which both programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition and dendritic cell (DC) vaccination are integrated in the first-line conventional platinum/pemetrexed-based treatment scheme for epithelioid MPM patients (Immuno-MESODEC, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05765084). Fifteen treatment-naïve patients with unresectable epithelioid subtype MPM will be treated with four 3-weekly (±3 days) chemo-immunotherapy cycles. Standard-of-care chemotherapy consisting of cisplatinum (75mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500mg/m2) will be supplemented with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (1200 mg) and autologous Wilms’ tumor 1 mRNA-electroporated dendritic cell (WT1/DC) vaccination (8–10 x 106 cells/vaccination). Additional atezolizumab (1680 mg) doses and/or WT1/DC vaccinations (8–10 x 106 cells/vaccination) can be administered optionally following completion of the chemo-immunotherapy scheme. Follow-up of patients will last for up to 90 days after final atezolizumab administration and/or WT1/DC vaccination or 24 months after diagnosis, whichever occurs later. The trial’s primary endpoints are safety and feasibility, secondary endpoints are clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. This phase I/II trial will evaluate whether addition of atezolizumab and WT1/DC vaccination to frontline standard-of-care chemotherapy for the treatment of epithelioid MPM is feasible and safe. If so, this novel combination strategy should be further investigated as a promising advanced treatment option for this hard-to-treat cancer.']",public,['19(7):e0307204'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFuIGRlbiBCb3NzY2hlLCBKb2xpZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Van den Bossche, Jolien'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1434-0837', 'prefLabel': 'De Laere, Maxime'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVzY2hlcHBlciwgS29lbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Deschepper, Koen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VybW9ucHLDqSwgUGF1bA==', 'prefLabel': 'Germonpré, Paul'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFsY2tlLCBZdmFu', 'prefLabel': 'Valcke, Yvan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFtb250LCBKYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lamont, Jan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RlaW4sIEJhcmJhcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Stein, Barbara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFuIENhbXAsIEtpcnN0ZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Van Camp, Kirsten'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VybW9ucHLDqSwgQ2hhcmxvdHRl', 'prefLabel': 'Germonpré, Charlotte'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmlqcywgR3JpZXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Nijs, Griet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9lbGFudCwgRWxsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Roelant, Ella'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW5ndWlsbGUsIFPDqWJhc3RpZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Anguille, Sébastien'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlvbiwgRXZh', 'prefLabel': 'Lion, Eva'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVybmVtYW4sIFp3aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Berneman, Zwi'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Integration of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab and WT1/DC vaccination into standard-of-care first-line treatment for patients with epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma—Protocol of the Immuno-MESODEC study'],2025-03-06T13:51:15.031+0100,337.0

Novel approaches for this lethal disease are urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with doxorubicin-eluting HepaSpheres (HS) for inoperable LMS of the prostate. METHODS: This case series included 12 patients (median age 57\u2009years, range 32–74) with inoperable LMS of the prostate who were treated with TACE using doxorubicin-eluting HS. All patients were pathologically proved by fine-needle biopsy. Symptomatic relief, complications, OS, and local disease control based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria were evaluated. RESULTS: Symptomatic relief, including control of the gross hematuria, removal of indwelling catheters, improvement of constipation and perineal pain, were obtained in 100%, 75%, 100%, and 86%, respectively after TACE, without any major complications. At the last follow-up after TACE, the percentage of the tumor necrosis and volume reduction were present with a median value of 90% and 84%, respectively. TACE after two to four sessions allowed subsequent surgical resection in five (41.7%) patients. The median follow-up time was 29\u2009months; the survival rate at 1, 2, and 3\u2009years was 91.7%, 83.3%, and 41.7%, respectively, and the median OS was 29\u2009months (range 9–49\u2009months).

The present study aimed to discover some potential peripheral blood biomarkers for early detection of patients with AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Publicly available AD datasets – GSE18309 and GSE97760 – were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and limma package from Bioconductor was employed to search for differently expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted correlation network analysis was performed to identify DEGs with highly synergistic changes, and functional annotation of DEGs was performed using gene set enrichment analysis and Metascape. STRING and Cytoscape were used to construct protein-protein interaction networks and analyze the most significant hub genes. Thereafter, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to identify hub genes associated with AD pathology, and Connectivity Map was used to screen small molecule drugs for AD. Finally, hub genes coupled with corresponding predicted miRNAs involved in AD were assessed via TargetScan, and functional annotation of predicted miRNAs was performed using DIANA database. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed 5042 DEGs; based on functional analyses, these DEGs were mainly associated with oligosaccharide lipid intermediate biosynthetic process, cyclin binding, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. UBB, UBA52, SRC, MMP9, VWF, GP6, and PF4 were identified as the hub genes. The CTD showed that these hub genes are closely related with AD or cognition impairment.

The Booroola fecundity (FecB) gene has a certain correlation with litter size in sheep. Therefore, this study aims to detect FecB expression quickly, accurately and visually. Here, we used the nucleic acid dye SYBR Green I to detect FecB with the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), which can efficiently, rapidly, economically and visually detect FecB expression in sheep. After ARMS polymerase chain reaction (PCR), SYBR Green I was directly added to the ARMS products, and whether the sheep carried FecB was judged by directly observing the color change in the PCR tube.

Darüber hinaus sind aber auch Maßnahmen zur CO2-Aufnahme aus der Atmosphäre und zur langfristigen Speicherung des Kohlenstoffs erforderlich, um die unvermeidbaren Restemissionen auszugleichen. Eine wichtige Maßnahme, die Staaten zur Verfügung steht, um dies zu erreichen, ist der Erhalt und die Ausweitung natürlicher Kohlenstoffsenken. In diesem Zusammenhang finden Maßnahmen zum Schutz und zur Wiederherstellung von Küstenökosystemen wie Mangrovenwäldern, Seegraswiesen und Salzmarschen zunehmend Beachtung, da sie wichtige natürliche marine Kohlenstoffsenken sind und in ihren Sedimenten viel Kohlenstoff pro Flächeneinheit speichern. Daher werden sie oft als ""Blue Carbon Ökosysteme"" (BCE) bezeichnet. Obwohl der Begriff ""Blue Carbon"" (BC) noch nicht einheitlich definiert ist, gewinnt er in der internationalen Klimapolitik immer mehr an Bedeutung und wird unter anderem im Zusammenhang mit dem (freiwilligen) Kohlenstoffmarkt diskutiert. Die vorliegende Studie gibt einen Überblick über die Verwendung des Begriffs BC in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur und in internationalen Berichten, um daraus eine Arbeitsdefinition von BC und Kriterien zur Identifizierung von BC-Maßnahmen abzuleiten (Kapitel 2). In den folgenden Kapiteln werden die positiven Beiträge und die Grenzen des globalen Klimaschutzpotenzials von BCE zusammengefasst und kritisch bewertet (Kapitel 3) sowie eine Zusammenfassung der Diskussionen und der zukünftigen Rolle von BC in der internationalen Klimapolitik präsentiert (Kapitel 4). In Kapitel 5 werden die Sichtbarkeit von BC-Emissionen und -Entnahmen in nationalen Treibhausgasinventaren zusammengefasst. Auf der Grundlage dieser Analysen werden in Kapitel 6 Schlussfolgerungen und Empfehlungen für die künftige Verwendung des Begriffs BC gegeben und sein potenzieller Beitrag zum globalen Klimaschutz zusammengefasst.', 'Achieving climate neutrality primarily requires reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in addition it requires measures to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and storing carbon in the long term to balance unavoidable residual emissions. A key measure available for countries to achieve this is to maintain and enlarge natural carbon sinks. In this respect, measures to protect and restore coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes are attracting growing attention as they are important natural marine carbon sinks and store a lot of carbon per unit area in their sediments. Therefore, they are often referred to as ""Blue Carbon ecosystems” (BCE). Although the term “Blue Carbon” (BC) is not yet uniformly defined, it is becoming more and more prominent in international climate policy and is being discussed in the context of the (voluntary) carbon market, among other things. This study provides an overview of the use of the term BC in scientific literature and international reports in order to derive a working definition of BC and criteria for identifying BC measures (Chapter 2). In the following chapters we summarize and critically assess positive contributions and limits of the global climate mitigation potential of BCE (Chapter 3) and present a summary of the discussions and the future role of BC in international climate policy (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, the visibility of BC emissions and removals in national GHG inventories is summarized. Based on these analyses, Chapter 6 provides conclusions and recommendations for the future use of the term BC and summarizes its potential contribution to global climate mitigation.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Reise, Judith', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1230500596'}, {'prefLabel': 'Urrutia, Cristina', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Urrutia, Cristina'}, {'prefLabel': 'Vittorelli, Laura von', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1213486033'}, {'prefLabel': 'Siemons, Anne', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Siemons, Anne'}, {'prefLabel': 'Jennerjahn, Tim C.', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1140865897'}, {'prefLabel': 'Voß, Katja', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Voß, Katja'}, {'prefLabel': 'Erxleben, Friederike', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Erxleben, Friederike'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutschland.

The WP:MD ratio used (1:2 or 1:3) yielded the formation of MCs, demonstrated by an increased browning index and changes in the protein secondary structure. Freeze-drying showed high encapsulation efficiency, reaching 87.65% and 84.72% in treatments loaded with 3.3\u2009mg quercetin/g MCs.

It involves using safe, non-toxic alternative solvents and sustainable natural resources to ensure the production of safe and high-quality extracts. Red onion skin is an important source of anthocyanins, a subgroup of phenolic compounds. Anthocyanins are an important group of natural pigments that have attracted a lot of attention due to their health benefits. However, the instability and high sensitivity of these pigments have limited their use in food and cosmetics. Therefore, in this study, various modern green extraction methods were used, including solvent extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, subcritical water extraction, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pulsed electric field extraction, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and high hydrostatic pressure-assisted (HHPAE) extraction, to specifically extract and purify anthocyanins. The extraction efficiency, specifically targeting anthocyanins, showed the highest efficiency with HHPAE (81.84%) and the lowest with MAE (40.01%). Measurement of total anthocyanin content revealed that HHPAE and SFE methods yielded the highest anthocyanin concentrations, with 248.49 and 244.98\u2009mg/L, respectively. Identification of anthocyanin by LC–MS revealed that the main anthocyanidins in red onion peel are pelargonidin, cyanidin, delphinidin, and petunidin. These results indicate that innovative green extraction methods, particularly HHPAE and SFE, can effectively replace conventional techniques due to their superior efficiency and enhanced preservation of anthocyanin compounds.']",public,['12(10):7347-7357'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWlyemF6YWRlaCwgTmFzaW0=', 'prefLabel': 'Mirzazadeh, Nasim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFnaGVyaSwgSGFkaXNlaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Bagheri, Hadiseh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWlyemF6YWRlaCwgTWVoZGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Mirzazadeh, Mehdi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sZWltYW5pbWVociwgU29tYXll', 'prefLabel': 'Soleimanimehr, Somaye'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFzaSwgRmF0ZW1laA==', 'prefLabel': 'Rasi, Fatemeh'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4214-1384', 'prefLabel': 'akhavan-mahdavi, sahar'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Comparison of different green extraction methods used for the extraction of anthocyanin from red onion skin'],2025-02-03T10:26:13.038+0100,286.0

BOE-WB was used as the soaking method. It was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods. The samples were prepared with three concentrations. It used Mueller Hinton Agar culture medium of fresh bacteria. It was incubated for 24\u2009h in a 37°C incubator. It identified 33 compounds. For BOE-W, 77% of the compounds are oxygenated, while for BOE-B, this percentage is 79%. For BOE-B, 79% had oxygenated compounds. BOE-WB has significant antibacterial effects on Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Bacillus cereus. The lethal impact of BOE-WB on strains is very close to that of doxycycline, and it can be introduced as a new antimicrobial drug to the medical world. The research shows that the percentage of oxygenated compounds in foods containing BOE-B is much higher than that of BOE-W. It has a significant impact on the antioxidant effect.

It is unclear whether stress resilience in PD is predominantly determined by dopamine deficiency, psychosocial factors, or both. In PD animal models, chronic stressors accelerate disease progression, but evidence in humans is lacking. Our objectives were to (1) distinguish stressor-reactive from resilient PD patients, (2) identify resilience factors, and (3) compare symptom progression between stressor-reactive and resilient patients. We conducted a longitudinal survey in Personalized Parkinson Project participants (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2009=\u2009350 PD). We used the COVID-19 pandemic as a model of a stressor, aligned in time for the entire cohort. COVID-19-related stressors, perceived stress, and PD symptoms were assessed at 11 timepoints (April-October 2020). Both pre-COVID and in-COVID clinical assessments were available. We quantified stressor-reactivity as the residual between actual and predicted perceived stress relative to COVID-19-related stressors, and modeled trajectories of stressor-reactivity across timepoints. We explored pre-COVID predictors of 6-month average stressor-reactivity, and tested whether stressor-reactivity was prospectively associated with one-year clinical progression rates.

Pre-existing anxiety, rumination and non-motor symptom severity predicted high stressor-reactivity (risk factors), whereas quality of life, social support, positive appraisal style and cognitive abilities predicted low stressor-reactivity (resilience factors). PD-specific factors, e.g. disease duration, motor severity, and levodopa use, did not predict stressor-reactivity.

Immediate transcranial evoked potentials (i-TEPs) have been obscured by pulse and muscular artifacts. Thus, the TEP peaks that are commonly reported have latencies that are too long to be caused by direct excitation of cortical neurons.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nIn 25 healthy individuals, we recorded i-TEPs evoked by a single biphasic TMS pulse targeting the primary motor hand area (M1HAND) or parietal or midline control sites. Sampling EEG at 50 kHz enabled us to reduce the duration of the TMS pulse artifact to a few milliseconds, while minor adjustments of the TMS coil tilt or position enabled us to avoid cranial muscular twitches during the experiment.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nWe observed an early positive EEG deflection starting after approx. 2 ms followed by a series of superimposed peaks with an inter-peak interval of ∼1.1–1.4 ms in multiple electrodes surrounding the stimulated sensorimotor region. This multi-peak i-TEP response was only evoked by TMS of the M1HAND region and was modified by changes in stimulation intensity and current direction.\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\nSingle-pulse TMS of the M1HAND evokes an immediate local multi-peak response at the cortical site of stimulation. Our results suggest that the observed i-TEP patterns are genuine cortical responses evoked by TMS caused by synchronized excitation of pyramidal neurons in the targeted precentral cortex. This notion needs to be corroborated in future studies, including further investigations into the potential contribution of instrumental or physiological artifacts.']",public,['17(4):802-812'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVjaywgTWlra2VsIE1hbGxpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Beck, Mikkel Malling'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hyaXN0aWFuc2VuLCBMYXNzZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Christiansen, Lasse'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFkc2VuLCBNYWRzIEFsZXhhbmRlciBKdXN0', 'prefLabel': 'Madsen, Mads Alexander Just'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFkaWRpLCBBcm1pdGEgRmFnaGFuaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jadidi, Armita Faghani'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmluZGluZywgTWlra2VsIENocmlzdG9mZmVy', 'prefLabel': 'Vinding, Mikkel Christoffer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGhpZWxzY2hlciwgQXhlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Thielscher, Axel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVyZ21hbm4sIFRpbCBPbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Bergmann, Til Ole'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llYm5lciwgSGFydHdpZyBSb21hbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Siebner, Hartwig Roman'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex elicits an immediate transcranial evoked potential'],2025-01-29T08:14:17.561+0100,336.0

Therefore, this study aims to conduct a scoping review to identify which digital nudges or recommender systems or their combinations have been used in obesity prevention and to map these systems according to the target population, health behaviour, system classification (eg, mechanisms for developing recommendations, delivery channels, personalisation, interconnection, used combination), and system implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guideline was used to inform protocol development. The eligibility criteria are based on the PCC framework (Population: any human; Concept: recommender systems or digital nudges; Context: obesity prevention).

Malta reports the highest neonatal mortality rate (NMR) among EU (European Union) Countries, constituting a public health concern. OBJECTIVES: This study describes the contribution of CA to NMR in Malta, investigating possible associations with known maternal risk factors of maternal age, nationality, and education. Additionally, it provides an update on the contribution of CA to neonatal deaths in Malta and other EU countries. METHODS: Anonymous data for births and neonatal deaths were obtained for 2006–2020 from the National Obstetrics Information System (NOIS) in Malta. Regression analyses adjusting for maternal risk factors were run on this data to explore possible associations with NMR. NMRs published by EUROSTAT 2011–2020 were used to compare mortality by underlying cause of death (CA or non-CA causes) for Malta and other EU countries. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2020, 63,890 live births with 283 neonatal deaths were registered in Malta, (NMR 4.4 per 1000 live births). CA accounted for 39.6% of neonatal deaths. No time trends were observed in either total NMR, NMR attributed to CA or mortality due to non-CA causes. Adjusted variables revealed associations for women hailing from non-EU, low-income countries. Malta registered high NMRs compared to EU countries, most marked for deaths attributed to CA. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2006 and 2020, Malta's NMR remained stable. Maternal Nationality, from non-EU low-income countries, was associated with higher neonatal mortality. The influx of such migrants may play a partial role in the high NMRs experienced. Malta's high NMR was primarily driven by early neonatal deaths, which included high proportions of deaths due to CA and is linked to the fact that termination of pregnancy is illegal in Malta.""]",public,['38(8):703-713'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-5166-3608', 'prefLabel': 'Wilhelm, Merle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2F0dCwgTWlyaWFt', 'prefLabel': 'Gatt, Miriam'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHJ6aWMsIFJvaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Hrzic, Rok'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FsbGVqYSwgTmV2aWxsZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Calleja, Neville'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-242X', 'prefLabel': 'Zeeb, Hajo'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Evaluating neonatal mortality in Malta compared with other EU countries: Exploring the influence of congenital anomalies and maternal risk factors'],2025-03-20T10:26:43.464+0100,266.0
frl:6510891,"[""There is a pressing need for healthy diets guided by environmental and nutritional targets. Plant-based proteins have emerged as a recent and rapidly growing trend in response to the challenge of sustainable and healthy food systems. While plant-based protein foods are widely promoted as sustainable alternatives, shifting beliefs and attitudes about conventional protein sources present an ongoing challenge. The study examined Canadians' intentions to transition to plant-based protein diets, partially or entirely. A nationally representative survey was conducted among Canadian consumers to achieve our research objective. The survey was administered online using the Qualtrics platform by a market research firm and yielded valid responses from over 1800 participants. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs—attitudes, self-efficacy, and perceived availability—explained only 12% of the variation in intentions toward plant-based protein foods, while sustainability and ethical concerns accounted for 10% of the variation in dietary patterns. Meat attachment negatively impacted changes in dietary patterns, explaining 11% of the intention variation. Additionally, individual past behavior accounted for 7% of intentions toward plant-based proteins. Demographic factors, such as gender and education, strongly and positively predicted purchase intentions, while contextual factors, such as residing in rural neighborhoods and being from Atlantic Canada, showed a strong negative association with intentions toward plant-based protein diets. The findings underscore the multifaceted nature of individuals' intentions toward plant-based protein diets and emphasize the significance of considering cognitive, social, emotional, and past behavioral factors, alongside sustainability values and messaging, to transition to a more plant-based protein diet.

In this study, we investigated the effects of sucralose on microglia during prolonged exposure via the neuroinflammatory and ferroptosis pathways. Initially, human microglial clone 3 (HMC3) cells were exposed to sucralose (0–50\u2009mM) for 24, 48, and 72\u2009h to investigate the short-term effects. Subsequently, HMC3 cells were treated with 1\u2009mM sucralose for 7, 14, and 21\u2009days to examine long-term effects. We measured levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4), reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), ferrous iron (Fe2+), and caspase 3/7. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of sucralose on cell morphology, migration, and expression levels of IL-1β, NLRP3, SIRT1, and GPx4. Sucralose inhibited cell viability and proliferation in HMC3 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and induced membrane and nuclear abnormalities. Moreover, sucralose significantly reduced the cell migration rate. Long-term sucralose treatment decreased Fe2+, GPx4, GSH, and SIRT1 levels in HMC3 cells while increasing IL-1β, MDA, NLRP3, 8-OHdG, and caspase 3/7 activity. Sucralose treatment also enhanced microglial activation and neuroinflammation by upregulating IL-1β and NLRP3 and downregulating SIRT1 and GPx4, thereby inducing ferroptosis and suppressing cell viability. Consequently, high concentrations or long-term sucralose treatment may induce neuroinflammation and ferroptosis by targeting the SIRT1/NLRP3/IL-1β/GPx4 pathway in HMC3 cells.']",public,['12(11):9094-9107'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0993-6118', 'prefLabel': 'Hacıoğlu, Ceyhan'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Long-term exposure of sucralose induces neuroinflammation and ferroptosis in human microglia cells via SIRT1/NLRP3/IL-1β/GPx4 signaling pathways'],2025-04-10T13:14:39.145+0200,286.0

We discuss challenges faced when organizing the ecosystem and derive lessons learned for similar networks acting during pandemics or health-related crises.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:\r\nBringing together 18 university hospitals and additional institutions, CEOsys key activities included research prioritization, conducting living systematic reviews (LSRs), supporting evidence-based (living) guidelines, knowledge translation (KT), detecting research gaps, and deriving recommendations, backed by technical infrastructure and capacity building.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nCEOsys rapidly produced 31 high-quality evidence syntheses and supported three living guidelines on COVID-19-related topics, while also developing methodological procedures. Challenges included CEOsys’ late initiation in relation to the pandemic outbreak, the delayed prioritization of research questions, the continuously evolving COVID-19-related evidence, and establishing a technical infrastructure. Methodological-clinical tandems, the cooperation with national guideline groups and international collaborations were key for efficiency.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nCEOsys provided a proof-of-concept for a functioning evidence ecosystem at the national level. Lessons learned include that similar networks should, among others, involve methodological and clinical key stakeholders early on, aim for (inter)national collaborations, and systematically evaluate their value.

frl:6489604,"['Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1. Furthermore, whereas depression is episodic, few longitudinal neuroimaging studies exist, limiting understanding of mechanisms that drive mood-state transitions. The emerging field of precision functional mapping has used densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to show behaviourally meaningful differences in brain network topography and connectivity between and in healthy individuals2,3,4, but this approach has not been applied in depression. Here, using precision functional mapping and several samples of deeply sampled individuals, we found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in several samples and caused primarily by network border shifts, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was stable over time, unaffected by mood state and detectable in children before the onset of depression later in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5\u2009years identified connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptoms and predicted future anhedonia symptoms. Together, these findings identify a trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state-dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.']",public,['633(8030):624-633'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THluY2gsIENoYXJsZXMgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lynch, Charles J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxiYXUsIEltbWFudWVsIEcu', 'prefLabel': 'Elbau, Immanuel G.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmcsIFRvbW15', 'prefLabel': 'Ng, Tommy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXlheiwgQWxpemE=', 'prefLabel': 'Ayaz, Aliza'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmh1LCBTaGFzaGEg', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Shasha '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29saywgRGFuaWVsbGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Wolk, Danielle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuZnJlZGksIE5pY29sYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Manfredi, Nicola'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Sm9obnNvbiwgTWVnYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Johnson, Megan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hhbmcsIE1lZ2Fu', 'prefLabel': 'Chang, Megan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hvdSwgSm9saW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Chou, Jolin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VtbWVydmlsbGUsIEluZGlyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Summerville, Indira'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG8sIENsYWlyZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Ho, Claire'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVlY2tlbCwgTWF4aW1pbGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lueckel, Maximilian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVraGFyaSwgSHVzc2Fpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Bukhari, Hussain'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVjaGFuYW4sIERlcnJpY2s=', 'prefLabel': 'Buchanan, Derrick'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmljdG9yaWEsIExpbmRzYXkgVy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Victoria, Lindsay W.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sb21vbm92LCBOaWxp', 'prefLabel': 'Solomonov, Nili'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29sZHdhc2VyLCBFcmlj', 'prefLabel': 'Goldwaser, Eric'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9pYSwgU3RlZmFubw==', 'prefLabel': 'Moia, Stefano'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FiYWxsZXJvLUdhdWRlcywgQ2VzYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Caballero-Gaudes, Cesar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG93bmFyLCBKb25hdGhhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Downar, Jonathan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlsYS1Sb2RyaWd1ZXosIEZpZGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Vila-Rodriguez, Fidel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFza2FsYWtpcywgWmFmaXJpcyBKLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Daskalakis, Zafiris J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qmx1bWJlcmdlciwgRGFuaWVsIE0u', 'prefLabel': 'Blumberger, Daniel M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2F5LCBLZW5kcmljaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Kay, Kendrick'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxveXNpLCBBbXk=', 'prefLabel': 'Aloysi, Amy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29yZG9uLCBFdmFuIE0u', 'prefLabel': 'Gordon, Evan M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmhhdGksIE1haGVuZHJhIFQu', 'prefLabel': 'Bhati, Mahendra T.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lsbGlhbXMsIE5vbGFu', 'prefLabel': 'Williams, Nolan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UG93ZXIsIEpvbmF0aGFuIEQu', 'prefLabel': 'Power, Jonathan D.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVibGV5LCBCZW5qYW1pbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Zebley, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3Jvc2VuaWNrLCBMb2dhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Grosenick, Logan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VubmluZywgRmFpdGggTS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Gunning, Faith M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzdG9uLCBDb25vcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Liston, Conor'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Frontostriatal salience network expansion in individuals in depression'],2025-01-29T08:17:26.866+0100,336.0

A multitude of prepandemic studies identified the beneficial effects of physical exercise on both physical and mental health.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: We report on the feasibility of a remote physical exercise intervention and its stress-buffering potential in 2 untrained cohorts: a pre–COVID-19 cohort that completed the intervention in 2019 and a lockdown cohort that started the intervention shortly before pandemic-related restrictions were implemented.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, participants were assigned to either an intervention group (IG; pre–COVID-19 cohort: n=7 and lockdown cohort: n=9) or a control group (CG; pre–COVID-19 cohort: n=6 and lockdown cohort: n=6). IG participants received weekly individualized training recommendations delivered via web-based support. The intervention period was initially planned for 8 weeks, which was adhered to in the pre–COVID-19 cohort (mean 8.3, SD 0.5 weeks) but was extended to an average of 17.7 (SD 2.0) weeks in the lockdown cohort. Participants’ health parameters were assessed before and after the intervention: aerobic capacity was measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) via cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Depressive symptoms were scored via the depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Dropout rates were low in both cohorts in the IG (pre–COVID-19 cohort: n=0, 0% and lockdown cohort: n=2, 16.7%) and the CG (pre–COVID-19 cohort: n=0, 0% and lockdown cohort: n=2, 20%). The mean adherence to the training sessions of the IG for both cohorts was 84% (pre–COVID-19 cohort: SD 5.5% and lockdown cohort: SD 11.6%). Aligned rank transform ANOVAs in the lockdown cohort indicated deterioration of VO2peak and depressive symptoms from before to after the intervention in the CG but no longitudinal changes in the IG. Analyses in the pre–COVID-19 cohort revealed significant increases in VO2peak for the IG compared to the CG (P=.04) but no intervention effects on depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: With low dropout rates and high adherence, the remote intervention was feasible for healthy adults under regular conditions and in the face of pandemic-related stressors. Moreover, our results hint at a stress-buffering effect as well as a buffering of a lockdown-induced deconditioning of remote physical exercise interventions in the pandemic scenario, which can be used in future studies to overcome equally stressful periods of life. However, due to limited statistical power, these findings should be replicated in similar scenarios.']",public,['26:e53145'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5179-538X', 'prefLabel': 'Philippi, Keito F.

The successful adaptation to adversity and maintenance or quick restoration of mental health despite adversity is referred to as resilience. Identifying factors that promote resilience can contribute to the prevention of mental disorders. Lifestyle behaviors, increasingly recognized for their impact on mental health, are discussed as potential resilience factors. Several studies found that healthy eating and physical activity (PA) are positively associated with resilience. However, most of these studies assessed resilience through questionnaires, which is unsatisfactory given that resilience research is moving toward conceptualizing resilience as the outcome of a dynamic process, which can only be assessed prospectively and longitudinally.

Resilience was assessed as the relationship between stressor exposure and mental health (i.e., the stressor reactivity score: higher scores indicate lower resilience and vice versa). Diet quality (i.e., the Healthy Eating Index) was assessed on the basis of app-based food records and 24-hr dietary recalls. PA and SB were objectively recorded through accelerometers. Regression analysis showed that neither diet quality nor PA and SB predicted resilience (ps > .30). Profound differences in the conceptualization and operationalization of resilience might explain the contrary findings. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to replicate the findings of the present study.']",public,['80(2):180-192'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-3249', 'prefLabel': 'Ruf, Alea'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3249-0409', 'prefLabel': 'Ahrens, Kira F.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-9657-900X', 'prefLabel': 'Gruber, Judith R.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9523-9425', 'prefLabel': 'Neumann, Rebecca'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4894-2756', 'prefLabel': 'Kollmann, Bianca'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9503-7601', 'prefLabel': 'Kalisch, Raffael'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9609-4261', 'prefLabel': 'Lieb, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4023-5301', 'prefLabel': 'Tuescher, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7161-0688', 'prefLabel': 'Plichta, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5789-2252', 'prefLabel': 'Nöthlings, Ute'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-5944', 'prefLabel': 'Ebner-Priemer, Ulrich W.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0992-634X', 'prefLabel': 'Reif, Andreas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7666-9534', 'prefLabel': 'Matura, Silke'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Move past adversity or bite through it?

Also, physicochemical and microbiological properties and lipid oxidation of cooked meat product coated with EF stored at +4°C for 14 d were evaluated. Cold plasma treatment increased the nitrite/nitrate concentrations and ORP value and decreased the pH value of distilled water (DW). The amount of TPC, IC50 value, and the antioxidant activity of OLE were 71.52\u2009mg GAE/g, 0.46\u2009mg/mL, and 77.39%, respectively. The combined use of OLE and PAW in EF during storage reduced the pH of cooked meat product. Furthermore, the addition of OLE in EF increased the b* values and reduced the a* values of cooked meat product, whereas the addition of PAW did not influence the CIE L*, a*, b* color values. The use of EF prevented lipid oxidation in cooked meat product during storage, especially the addition of OLE to the EF reduced the TBARS values. In this research, the addition of OLE to EF prepared with PAW has a promising application potential in the preservation of RTE-cooked meat products.

In this study, we aimed to identify anti-obesity peptides from whey protein. Our findings revealed that WPH suppressed the accumulation of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Anti-obesity peptides in WPH were identified using amino acid sequencing and LC–MS analysis. Then, the inhibitory effects of the synthetic peptides on adipogenesis were assessed through Oil Red O staining. Two peptides were identified as anti-adipogenic: LDQW and LKPTPEGDLEIL. Subsequently, real-time PCR analysis found that several adipogenesis-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, were downregulated in the treatment with these peptides. Furthermore, LDQW and LKPTPEGDLEIL decreased the mRNA expression levels of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings indicate that LDQW and LKPTPEGDLEIL have anti-obesity properties and may be beneficial for treating metabolic diseases.

We tested proximal sensing as an alternative to standard laboratory methods to capture the spatial variability of SMN, nitrate (NO3−), and soil moisture (SM) and combined these data with topographic and remote sensing inputs to delineate MZ using data fusion and k-means clustering. Two conventionally managed fields with winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were chosen for Field-A and Field-B. Fresh soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory using KCl extraction, while global positioning system-labeled data from a proximal soil sensor (FarmLab) were accessed via cloud storage. FarmLab estimated NO3− and SMN were higher than laboratory results (p < 0.05), whereas SM showed no significant difference between the two methods. Bland–Altman analysis, which assesses the limit of agreement between methods to ensure consistency, revealed significant discrepancies in NO₃⁻ estimated by both methods, particularly in Field-B, with limits of agreement ranging from −17.40 to 29.66 mg kg−1. Results of k-means clustering, a method for grouping data into similar categories, were evaluated using 11 feature sets, which combine data from multiple sources (laboratory and FarmLab data, satellites, and topographic data) to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis at different time points in autumn and spring. The results showed that the optimal clustering result varied depending on the field and date. Feature sets with topographic variables performed well in Field-A, while feature sets with remote sensing, topography, and FarmLab data improved MZ in Field-B. This study demonstrates how the FarmLab device can capture within-field SMN variability and examines the similarities and differences between both methods (laboratory and FarmLab). Despite discrepancies between methods, FarmLab showed the potential of integrating in-season NO3− and SMN data with topographic and remote sensing data to delineate MZ. This approach can be scaled up to farm and landscape scale, allowing farmers to leverage proximal and remote sensing data for in-season SMN monitoring, which enables efficient nutrient management and promotes sustainable farming practices with economic and environmental benefits.']",public,['8(1):e70051'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9zc2FpbiwgTWQgVGF3aGlk', 'prefLabel': 'Hossain, Md Tawhid'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9uYXQsIE1hcmNv', 'prefLabel': 'Donat, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG91Z21hLCBJbmVzIEFzdHJpZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Tougma, Ines Astrid'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVsbGluZ3JhdGgtS2ltdXJhLCBTb25va28gRC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bellingrath-Kimura, Sonoko D.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JhaG1hbm4sIEthdGhyaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Grahmann, Kathrin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Nitrogen-based proximal sensing and data fusion for management zone delineation'],2025-05-26T13:46:59.335+0200,333.0

Despite this limitation, field-scale calibrated crop models for high-yielding traits are being applied over large scales using gridded weather and soil datasets. This study investigates the implications of this practice. The SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied using field, 1 km, 25 km, and 50 km input data resolution and sources, with 1881 combinations of three traits [radiation use efficiency (RUE), light extinction coefficient (K), and fruiting efficiency (FE)] for the period 2001–2010 across Germany. Simulations at the grid level were aggregated to the administrative units, enabling the quantification of the aggregation effect. The simulated yield increased by between 1.4 and 3.1 t ha−\u20091 with a maximum RUE trait value, compared to a control cultivar. No significant yield improvement (<\u20090.4 t ha−\u20091) was observed with increases in K and FE alone. Utilizing field-scale input data showed the greatest yield improvement per unit increment in RUE. Resolution of water related inputs (soil characteristics and precipitation) had a notably higher impact on simulated yield than of temperature.

High requirements on planning and inefficient advice in agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been identified as obstacles to the implementation of beetle banks on sloped farmland. This study presents a novel digital and automated method to identify potential sites for such beetle banks and discusses implications for practical implementation as well as concepts to integrate the method into farm management information systems (FMIS) for AES. First, suitable in-field routes of tractors (waylines) are selected in a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) considering management costs and erosion control under practical conditions. Elevation profiles of selected waylines are then analyzed to identify sections for beetle banks that build basins for water retention, demonstrated by a flow accumulation model. The method may be integrated into FMIS to improve the implementation of AES by supporting farmers in i) decision making by providing potential locations for beetle banks evaluated regarding ecological benefits and subsidy payments ii) implementing beetle banks on suitable sites using precision farming technologies and iii) managing AES applications. This may increase the ecological benefits and cost-effectiveness of measures and reduces financial risks and bureaucratic efforts for farmers.

The study applied the SUBSTOR-Potato model and outputs of 24 general circulation models to capture future variability in climate conditions for four shared socioeconomic pathway-representative concentration pathway scenarios. Without planting date adjustment, tuber yield was projected to increase by approximately 20% for spring and summer potato, indicating that the CO2 fertilization effect would offset the adverse effect of rising temperature. The effect of planting date adjustment was significant only for spring potato, where overall climate change impact with the optimized planting date was approximately\u2009 +60%. For spring potato, the effects of rising temperature were bidirectional: temperature increases early in the year extended the growing season, whereas the higher temperature increases in June under the most severe climate change condition accelerated leaf senescence and reduced tuber bulking rate. Based on these results, different adaptation strategies could be established for spring potato for different climate change conditions. For example, developing frost-tolerant cultivars would continue to be recommended to plant earlier under the mild climate change conditions, whereas breeding mid-late maturity cultivars with high-temperature tolerance would be needed to delay senescence and enhance late tuber growth under the severe climate change conditions. Unlike spring potato, the breeding goal for summer potato of increasing high-temperature tolerance holds across all climate change conditions. Finally, these optimistic results should be interpreted with caution as the current model does not fully capture the effect of high-temperature episodes and the interactive effect between CO2 and temperature, which may reduce beneficial projected climate change impacts.']",public,['67(4):1265-1286'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9431-8575', 'prefLabel': 'Kim, Yean-Uk'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8301-5424', 'prefLabel': 'Webber, Heidi'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Contrasting Responses of Spring and Summer Potato to Climate Change in South Korea'],2025-05-15T09:48:08.777+0200,333.0

However, agroforestry uptake remains low in Germany. Since economic considerations are important for farmer uptake, this paper compares the economic performance of conventional arable farming with silvoarable alley cropping in Brandenburg. Using a modelling approach, the net present value (NPV) is calculated to assess the competitiveness of alley cropping with poplar compared to arable farming under different scenarios. These scenarios cover a range of crops, rotation schedules, alley widths, woodchip prices, and yield levels. Additionally, policy measures that can compensate for potential economic losses associated with transitioning to agroforestry are considered. Results show that short rotation alley cropping had higher NPVs than medium rotation alley cropping, mainly due to cash-flow characteristics. Short rotation alley cropping can be competitive at high woodchip prices without policy support, while at low or average prices alley cropping needs subsidies to be competitive. Medium rotation systems at all price levels were not competitive unless policy support was provided. Current policy payments were unable to make silvoarable alley cropping competitive except at high woodchip prices. When subsidies increase, alley cropping can be competitive even at low or average woodchip prices and over a range of site conditions. Besides policy support, economic performance was strongly influenced by woodchip prices, relative yield potential of poplar and arable crops, and site conditions.']",public,['98(6):1507-1522'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3027-8244', 'prefLabel': 'Thiesmeier, Alma'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Comparing the economic performance of poplar-based alley cropping systems with arable farming in Brandenburg under varying site conditions and policy scenarios'],2025-05-15T10:15:02.065+0200,333.0

Here, we present a fully automatic, low-cost (EUR\u2009<1000 per unit) multi-chamber system based on Arduino, termed “greenhouse coffins”. It is designed to continuously measure canopy CO2 and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes. It can operate in two modes: an independent and a dependent measurement mode. The independent measurement mode utilizes low-cost NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) CO2 (K30 FR) and relative humidity (SHT31) sensors, thus making each greenhouse coffin a fully independent measurement device. The dependent measurement mode connects multiple greenhouse coffins via a low-cost multiplexer (EUR\u2009<250) to a single infrared gas analyzer (LI-850, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, USA), allowing for measurements in series, achieving cost efficiency while also gaining more flexibility in terms of target GHG fluxes (potential extension to N2O, CH4 and stable isotopes). In both modes, CO2 and ET fluxes are determined through the respective concentration increase during closure time. We tested both modes and demonstrated that the presented system is able to deliver precise and accurate CO2 and ET flux measurements using low-cost sensors, with an emphasis on calibrating the sensors to improve measurement precision. By connecting multiple greenhouse coffins via our low-cost multiplexer to a single infrared gas analyzer in the dependent mode, we could additionally show that the system can efficiently measure CO2 and ET fluxes in a high temporal resolution across various treatments with both labor and cost efficiency. Therefore, the developed system is expected to be a valuable tool for conducting greenhouse experiments, enabling comprehensive testing of plant–soil dynamic responses to various treatments and conditions.""]",public,['21(24):5639-5651'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwgSGFtd2ksIFdhZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Al Hamwi, Wael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHViYmVydCwgTWFyZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Dubbert, Maren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoYWxsZXIsIErDtnJn', 'prefLabel': 'Schaller, Jörg'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO8Y2ssIE1hdHRoaWFz', 'prefLabel': 'Lück, Matthias'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobWlkdCwgTWFydGVu', 'prefLabel': 'Schmidt, Marten'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9mZm1hbm4sIE1hdGhpYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffmann, Mathias'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Technical note: A low-cost, automatic soil–plant–atmosphere enclosure system to investigate CO2 and evapotranspiration flux dynamics']",2025-02-05T09:16:44.467+0100,333.0
frl:6510315,"['One possible solution for regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being in deforested and degraded landscapes is Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR). Togo has set a goal to restore 1.4 million hectares of lands by 2030. Despite the national commitment to FLR, no significant progress has been made and drivers that impact FLR adoption remain poorly understood. Thus, it is crucial to enhance knowledge on drivers influencing the adoption of FLR to facilitate its implementation while also providing recommendations for policy and practice. Surveying 494 Togolese smallholder farmers, this study focuses on socio-economic, biophysical, geographical, and institutional aspects of FLR as well as farmers’ perceptions. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression are employed to provide a model of the drivers affecting FLR in Togo. The results reveal that 43.62% of smallholder farmers adopt FLR practices in the study areas. FLR practices linked to agricultural land restoration, such as improved fallow and crop rotation system (33.40%) and agroforestry (32.19%), are the most widely adopted, followed by reforestation (13.36%), community forest creation (8.7%), commercial forest plantation (7.29%), and sacred forest enrichment (2.83%). Results also indicate that smallholder farmers in cooperatives and involved in restoration activities have a higher awareness of the importance of restoration and willingness to adopt practices. Similar observations are made for farmers living in a zone with high exposure to FLR activities. Secure property rights also support adopting FLR practices. Further, the services of local technicians or facilitators create favorable conditions that encourage smallholders to implement FLR practices. Perception of restoration practices and need, motivation for maintaining restoration practices, and relevance for food security greatly impact smallholder farmer adoption. These results suggest that FLR practices can be increased through training and access to seedlings, supporting reforestation and community forest creation by incentivizing smallholder participation through subsidies or technical assistance, clarifying and strengthening smallholders’ land rights, and deploying more local technicians.']",public,['8:1425797'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0212-7331', 'prefLabel': 'HOUNKPATI, Kossi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5067-2871', 'prefLabel': 'Moluh Njoya, Hamza '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8491-8107', 'prefLabel': 'Kossi, Adjonou'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4849-7277', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2691-9712', 'prefLabel': 'Löhr, Katharina'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Drivers affecting adoption of forest landscape restoration among smallholder farmers in Central Togo'],2025-03-06T10:52:21.743+0100,333.0

Here, we analyse the survival and reproduction of the German wolf population in the 20 years following recolonization. Specifically, we analysed the effects of environmental, ecological and individual characteristics on 1) survival probability of the population; 2) annual survival rates of age classes; 3) reproduction probability; and 4) reproductive output, measured as the number of detected pups/juveniles. Using Cox proportional hazards model, we estimated a median survival time of circa three years for wolves. Annual survival probabilities were found to be 0.75 for juveniles, 0.75 for subadults and 0.88 for adults. Survival was lower for juveniles in winter and for subadult males in summer, probably associated with dispersal events. Low habitat suitability was clearly associated with lower survival in juveniles and subadults, but not in adults. Local territory density was related to increased survival. Reproduction probability within a territory was 0.88, but explanatory variables had no effect. Reproductive output was four pups/juveniles on average, positively related to habitat suitability and female experience, but negatively related to territory density. Survival values were very high for the species when compared to other regions. We hypothesize that carrying capacity has not been reached in the study area, thus the survival may decrease in the future if the landscape becomes saturated. Furthermore, our results highlight a spatial pattern in survival and reproduction, with area of better habitat suitability favouring faster population growth. Thus, targeting conservation measures to low habitat suitability areas will have a strong population effect on the short term by boosting survival and reproduction of the individuals, while long-term viability should be carefully planned with high suitability areas in mind, as those contain the territories with higher survival and reproduction potential.']",public,['2024(6):e01246'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6763-9923', 'prefLabel': 'Planillo, Aimara'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4314-3362', 'prefLabel': 'Reinhardt, Ilka'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2x1dGgsIEdlc2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Kluth, Gesa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7309-5448', 'prefLabel': 'Collet, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9sc2hhdXNlbiwgR3JlZ29y', 'prefLabel': 'Rolshausen, Gregor'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tm93YWssIENhcnN0ZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Nowak, Carsten'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6111-5213', 'prefLabel': 'Steyer, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxsd2FuZ2VyLCBHb2V0eg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ellwanger, Goetz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9269-4446', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Habitat and density effects on the demography of an expanding wolf population in Central Europe'],2025-06-12T07:40:59.647+0200,336.0

In addition to the inter-specific size difference, females of both species are also larger than the respective males (reversed sexual size dimorphism). Although both boobies consume similar prey, sometimes in mixed-species flocks, each species and sex may specialize in terms of their diet or foraging habitats. We examined inter- and intra-specific differences in isotopic values (δ13C and δ15N) in these pelagically feeding booby species during the incubation period at Clarion Island, Mexico, to quantify the degrees of inter- and intra-specific niche partitioning throughout the annual cycle. During incubation, both species preyed mainly on flyingfish and squid, but masked boobies had heavier food loads than red-footed boobies. There was no overlap in isotopic niches between masked and red-footed boobies during breeding (determined from whole blood), but there was slight overlap during the non-breeding period (determined from body feathers). Female masked boobies had a higher trophic position than conspecific males during breeding; however, no such pattern was detected in red-footed boobies. These results provide evidence of inter- and intra-specific niche partitioning in these tropical seabird species, particularly during the breeding period and in the more-dimorphic species.

frl:6511750,"['The relationship between δ18O and δ15N in aquatic nitrate (NO3–) is used to assess nitrogen (N) cycling, primarily relying on controlled laboratory tests of isotope fractionation from nitrification and denitrification. Nevertheless, laboratory findings frequently contradict the evolution of the nitrate δ18O/δ15N ratios observed in natural river systems. We investigated this disparity by using moderated regression modeling, analyzing a global data set (n = 1303) of nitrate isotopes encompassing rivers with varying NH4+/NO3– ratios and δ18O–H2O values. First, our analysis revealed that elevated δ18O/δ15N ratios (>0.6) were prevalent in rivers with high NH4+/NO3– ratios, suggesting reducing conditions that could potentially promote denitrification and/or ammonium accumulation. By contrast, lower δ18O/δ15N ratios (<0.5) predominated in rivers with low NH4+/NO3– conditions, suggesting oxidizing conditions favoring increased NH4+ removal through nitrification. Second, when δ18O–H2O values were low, it resulted in reduced δ18O–NO3– values during nitrification, which in turn lowered the δ18O/δ15N ratios. We discovered that the δ18O/δ15N ratios in nitrate were elevated in the fall, likely due to predominant processes, such as denitrification, and lower in the winter due to lower δ18O–H2O values. This global river assessment suggests a more significant influence of ammonium and the role of water oxygen in riverine N-nutrient isotope cycling than was previously considered.']",public,['4(4):1451-1459'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0395-2678', 'prefLabel': 'Matiatos, Ioannis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9udGVpcm8sIEx1Y2lsZW5hIFIu', 'prefLabel': 'Monteiro, Lucilena R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2ViaWxvLCBNYXRoaWV1', 'prefLabel': 'Sebilo, Mathieu'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-293X', 'prefLabel': 'Soto, David X.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6015-1332', 'prefLabel': 'Gooddy, Daren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2Fzc2VuYWFyLCBMZW9uYXJkIEku', 'prefLabel': 'Wassenaar, Leonard I.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Isotopes Reveal the Moderating Role of Ammonium on Global Riverine Water Nitrogen Cycling'],2025-06-12T07:32:36.325+0200,336.0

This review aims to evaluate emerging ASMs—cenobamate, fenfluramine, ganaxolone, ezogabine (retigabine), and perampanel—with a focus on their mechanisms of action, pharmacological profiles, and potential role in precision medicine. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the selected ASMs. Relevant trials, reviews, and mechanistic studies were reviewed to synthesize the current understanding of their application in DRE and specific epilepsy syndromes. Each ASM demonstrated unique mechanisms targeting hyperexcitability, including the modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABA-A) receptors, sodium and potassium channels, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA receptors), and serotonin systems. These mechanisms correspond with specific pathophysiological features in syndromes such as Dravet and Lennox–Gastaut. Evidence from clinical trials supports their use as adjunctive therapies with generally favorable tolerability, though adverse events and variable efficacy profiles were noted. The mechanistic diversity of these emerging ASMs supports their value in personalized epilepsy management, particularly in treatment-resistant cases.

As these epidemics continue to spread, the continuation of further research is paramount given that chronic diseases, such as T2DM, cause strain on both economies and healthcare systems. Recently, adipose tissue has been identified as an endocrine organ that produces many hormones that influence many bodily processes. Adipose tissue dysregulation (ATD)—when adipokines (adipose tissue hormones) are produced in abnormal amounts—plays an important role in T2DM development, progression, and prognosis. This narrative review focuses on mechanisms linking ATD with T2DM through adipokine actions (specifically, leptin and adiponectin) on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Here we show that the adipokines leptin and adiponectin are valuable in monitoring, diagnosing, and treating diseases. Further, their ratio (the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, or LAR) may be more valuable than either adipokine individually. The LAR may give researchers the ability to utilize a primary prevention approach by utilizing LAR as a biomarker influencing early prognosis and treatment. Targeting ATD through diet, weight loss, physical activity, etc., may improve prevention and management outcomes for patients living with or at risk of T2DM.']",public,['13(7):1770'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8310-1584', 'prefLabel': 'Rausch, Jamie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0001-2059-5318', 'prefLabel': 'Horne, Kaitlyn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFycXVleiwgTHVpcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Marquez, Luis'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The Effects of Adipose Tissue Dysregulation on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus'],2025-07-21T12:20:49.339+0200,355.0

Both species have more dorsal than ventral major trunk wrinkles and a closer wrinkle spacing distally than proximally. In Asian elephants, wrinkle density is high in the ‘trunk wrapping zone’. Wrinkle numbers on the left and right sides of the distal trunk differed as a function of trunk lateralization, with frequent bending in one direction causing wrinkle formation. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging and microscopy of newborn elephants’ trunks revealed a constant thickness of the putative epidermis, whereas the putative dermis shrinks in the wrinkle troughs. During fetal development, wrinkle numbers double every 20 days in an early exponential phase. Later wrinkles are added slowly, but at a faster rate in Asian than African elephants.

Although the etiopathogenesis is not entirely clear, the involvement of inflammatory processes, the endocannabinoid system, and alterations in the permeability and composition of the intestinal microbiota are known to occur. METHODS: This review systematically explores the literature available to date on the most widely used murine models for the study of ASD, the main biomarkers investigated for the diagnosis of ASD, and the therapeutic potential of probiotics, with a particular focus on the use of strains of Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb.) plantarum in in vivo models and clinical trials for ASD. RESULTS: Several studies have demonstrated that targeting multifactorial biomarkers in animal models and patients contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying ASD. Moreover, accumulating evidence supports the beneficial effect of probiotics, including Lpb. plantarum, as a promising alternative therapeutic strategy, capable of modulating gut–brain axis communication. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation, particularly with selected Lpb. plantarum strains, is emerging as a potential complementary approach for ameliorating ASD-related gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms.

We developed an individual-based modelling approach to estimate time-varying carrying capacity (Kt) in a population of free-ranging spotted hyenas. Kt noticeably varied due to events such as disease outbreaks, but not in response to recent conservation interventions. Although the population tripled in size during the 26-year study period, we found no corresponding trend in Kt. Rather, population recovery resulted from earlier environmental improvements.

However, most evidence comes from tropical rainforest landscapes, whereas the bearing of such trends in other forest types remains understudied. We compared functional and beta diversity of bird communities in 23 cacao agroforests embedded in landscapes of two contrasting Peruvian regions: seasonally-dry tropical forests and subtropical rainforests from the Andean foothills. Strong climatic seasonality affects both landscapes, but forest vegetation structure and complexity differ. We found higher bird species richness (n\u2009=\u2009179 spp) and higher species turnover in the subtropical forest than in the dry forest landscape (n\u2009=\u200964 spp). Only in the dry forest landscape, distance from forest increased dissimilarity driven by species loss, that is, the nestedness component of beta diversity. This points to the importance of conserving dry tropical forests within the broader landscape matrix, with known benefits for pest control and cacao yield. Functional diversity indices were not influenced by forest distance in either landscape, but the proportion of insects in birds' diet decreased by 27% along a 1\u2009km distance gradient from forest in the subtropical forest landscape. In the dry forest landscape, however, it decreased by only 3% across the same distance gradient. Far from forest (≥1\u2009km), forest specialization decreased by ~33% and 20% in the subtropical and dry forest landscapes, respectively. These differences indicate that regionally-adapted agroforest management is paramount for conserving bird diversity and ecosystem services as pest control. Procuring high-canopy shade trees and adequate microhabitats for insectivorous species is essential to maintain biocontrol services in the subtropical forest. Conversely, in the dry forest enhancing low-canopy vegetation with a focus on frugivores and ensuring forest closeness to agroforests may maximize bird diversity and their ecosystem services.

So far, these research results have only been considered separately. In this study, we investigated the influence on reproduction of both phytochemicals, mainly dietary IFs, and the metabolic phenotype represented by three mouse models considered as three distinct genetic groups (a control group, a mouse model with high metabolic activity, and a mouse line with obese body weight). The IF content in different investigated standard chows with similar macronutrient profiles varied significantly (p < 0.005), leading to high mean total plasma IF levels of up to 5.8 µmol/L in juvenile and 6.7 µmol/L in adult female mice. Reproductive performance was only slightly affected; only an IF dose-dependent effect on gestation length was observed in all genetic groups, as well as an effect on pregnancy rate in obese mice. Dietary IF exposure, however, caused earlier onset of vaginal opening by 4–10 days in juvenile mice (p < 0.05), dependent on the genetic group, resulting in a slight acceleration of sexual maturation in the already precocious obese model and to a strong earlier maturation in the otherwise late-maturing sporty model, bred for high treadmill performance.

Sarcocystis sporocysts collected from rat snakes (Coelognathus radiatus, C. flavolineatus) in Thailand induced development of sarcocysts in experimental SD rats showing a type 10a cyst wall ultrastructure that was identical with those found in Rattus norvegicus from China and the forest rat Maxomys whiteheadi in Borneo. Its cystozoites had equal sizes in all intermediate hosts and locations, while sporocysts and cystozoites were distinct from other Sarcocystis species. Partial 28S rRNA sequences of S. muricoelognathis from M. whiteheadi were largely identical to those from R. norvegicus in China but distinct from newly sequenced Sarcocystis zuoi. The phylogeny of the nuclear 18S rRNA gene placed S. muricoelognathis within the so-called S. zuoi complex, including Sarcocystis attenuati, S. kani, S. scandentiborneensis and S. zuoi, while the latter clustered with the new species. However, the phylogeny of the ITS1-region confirmed the distinction between S. muricoelognathis and S. zuoi. Moreover, all three gene trees suggested that an isolate previously addressed as S. zuoi from Thailand (KU341120) is conspecific with S. muricoelognathis. Partial mitochondrial cox1 sequences of S. muricoelognathis were almost identical with those from other members of the group suggesting a shared, recent ancestry.

Here, we investigate features of elephant mouth organization that presumably promote lateralization. We find the lower jaw of elephants is of narrow width, but is rostrally strongly elongated even beyond the jaw bone. Elephant lip vibrissae become progressively longer rostrally. Thus, elephants have two lateral dense, short microvibrissae arrays and central, less dense long macrovibrissae. This is an inversion of the ancestral mammalian facial vibrissae pattern, where central, dense short microvibrissae are flanked by two lateral macrovibrissae arrays. Elephant microvibrissae have smaller follicles than macrovibrissae. Similar to trunk-tip vibrissae, elephant lip microvibrissae show laterally asymmetric abrasion. Observations on Asian zoo elephants indicate lateralized abrasion results from lateralized feeding. It appears that the ancestral mammalian mouth (upper and lower lips, incisors, frontal microvibrissae) is shaped by oral food apprehension. The elephant mouth organization radically changed, however, because trunk-mediated feeding replaced oral apprehension.

frl:6511786,"['BACKGROUND:\r\nExplanations for the genesis and propagation of cholera pandemics since 1817 have remained elusive. Evolutionary pathogen change is presumed to have been a dominant factor behind the 7th “El Tor” pandemic, but little is known to support this hypothesis for preceding pandemics. The role of anomalous climate in facilitating strain replacements has never been assessed. The question is of relevance to guide the understanding of infectious disease emergence today and in the context of climate change.\r\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:\r\nWe investigate the roles of climate and putative strain variation for the 6th cholera pandemic (1899–1923) using newly assembled historical records for climate variables and cholera deaths in provinces of former British India. We compare this historical pandemic with the 7th (El Tor) one and with the temporary emergence of the O139 strain in Bangladesh and globally. With statistical methods for nonlinear time series analysis, we examine the regional synchrony of outbreaks and associations of the disease with regional temperature and rainfall, and with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To establish future expectations and evaluate climate anomalies accompanying historical strain replacements, climate projections are generated with multi-model climate simulations for different 50-year periods.\r\nThe 6th cholera pandemic featured the striking synchronisation of cholera outbreaks over Bengal during the El Niño event of 1904–07, following the invasion of the Bombay Presidency with a delay of a few years. Accompanying anomalous weather conditions are similar to those related to ENSO during strain replacements and pandemic expansions into Africa and South America in the late 20th century. Rainfall anomalies of 1904–05 at the beginning of the large cholera anomaly fall in the 99th percentile of simulated changes for the regional climate.\r\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:\r\nEvolutionary pathogen change can act synergistically with climatic conditions in the emergence and propagation of cholera strains. Increased climate variability and extremes under global warming provide windows of opportunity for emerging pathogens.\r\n']",public,['18(8):e0012275'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4843-6180', 'prefLabel': 'Rodó, Xavier'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm91bWEsIE1lbm5vIEphbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Bouma, Menno Jan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9kcsOtZ3Vlei1BcmlhcywgTWlxdWVsLcOAbmdlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Rodríguez-Arias, Miquel-Àngel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um95LCBNYW5vaml0', 'prefLabel': 'Roy, Manojit'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGUgWWVicmEsIFBhdQ==', 'prefLabel': 'De Yebra, Pau'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0cm92YSwgRGVzaXNsYXZh', 'prefLabel': 'Petrova, Desislava'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FyY8OtYS1Ew61leiwgTWFya2Vs', 'prefLabel': 'García-Díez, Markel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFzY3VhbCwgTWVyY2VkZXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Pascual, Mercedes'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Strain variation and anomalous climate synergistically influence cholera pandemics'],2025-06-12T07:44:15.921+0200,336.0
frl:6511798,"['State variables such as abundance and occurrence of species are central to many questions in ecology and conservation, but our ability to detect and enumerate species is imperfect and often varies across space and time. Accounting for imperfect and variable detection is important for obtaining unbiased estimates of state variables. Here, I investigate whether closed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) and single season occupancy models are robust to ignoring temporal variation in detection probability. Ignoring temporal variation allows collapsing detection data across repeated sampling occasions, speeding up computations, which can be important when analyzing large datasets with complex models. I simulated data under different scenarios of temporal and spatio-temporal variation in detection, analyzed data with the data-generating model and an alternative model ignoring temporal variation in detection, and compared estimates between these two models with respect to relative bias, coefficient of variation (CV) and relative root mean squared error (RMSE). SCR model estimates of abundance, the density-covariate coefficient β and the movement-related scale parameter of the detection function σ were robust to ignoring temporal variation in detection, with relative bias, CV and RMSE of the two models generally being within 4% of each other. An SCR case study for brown tree snakes showed identical estimates of density and σ under models accounting for or ignoring temporal variation in detection. Occupancy model estimates of the occupancy-covariate coefficient β and average occupancy were also largely robust to ignoring temporal variation in detection, and differences in occupancy predictions were mostly <<0.1. But there was a slight tendency for bias in β under the alternative model to increase when detection varied more strongly over time. Thus, when temporal variation in detection is extreme, it may be necessary to model that variation to avoid bias in parameter estimates in occupancy models. An occupancy case study for ten bird species with a more complex model structure showed considerable differences in occupancy parameter estimates under models accounting for or ignoring temporal variation in detection; but estimates and predictions from the latter were always within 95% confidence intervals of the former. There are cases where we cannot or may not want to ignore temporal variation in detection: a behavioral response to detection and certain SCR observation models do not allow collapsing data across sampling occasions; and temporal variation in detection may be informative of species phenology/behavior or for future study planning. But this study shows that it can be safely ignored under a range of conditions when analyzing SCR or occupancy data.']",public,['4:e1'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sbG1hbm4sIFJhaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Sollmann, Rahel'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Mt or not Mt: Temporal variation in detection probability in spatial capture-recapture and occupancy models'],2025-06-12T07:47:48.166+0200,336.0

DESIGN: PASS programme of rivaroxaban carried out as part of the regulatory postapproval commitment to the European Medicines Agency. SETTING: Clinical practice in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (electronic health records)—undertaken by pharmacoepidemiology research teams using country-specific databases with different coding structures. PARTICIPANTS: 355\u2009152 patients prescribed rivaroxaban and 338\u2009199 patients prescribed vitamin K antagonists. RESULTS: Two major challenges that were encountered throughout the lengthy PASS programme were related to: (1) finalising country-tailored study designs before the extent of rivaroxaban uptake was known, and (2) new research questions that arose during the programme (eg, those relating to an evolving prescribing landscape). RECOMMENDATIONS: We advocate the following strategies to help address these major challenges (should they arise in any future PASS): conducting studies based on a common data model that enable the same analytical tools to be applied when using different databases; maintaining early, clear, continuous communication with the regulator (including discussing the potential benefit of studying drug use as a precursor to planning a safety study); consideration of adaptive designs whenever uncertainty exists and following an initial period of data collection; and setting milestones for the review of study objectives.']",public,['14(3):e081348'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7446-9851', 'prefLabel': 'Brobert, Gunnar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVpZ29tZXosIEFuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Ruigomez, Ana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0224-1866', 'prefLabel': 'Schink, Tania'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8109-1108', 'prefLabel': 'Voss, Annemarie '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2561-8734', 'prefLabel': 'Herings, Ron'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1882-4748', 'prefLabel': 'Smits, Elisabeth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3dhcnQsIEthcmluIE0uIEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Swart, Karin M.

frl:6510923,"['Researchers are increasingly exploring the existence and potential implications of pain-related cognitive biases in clinical and non-clinical populations, using a range of paradigms and stimuli to test theoretical predictions and refine models. One avenue of investigation explores the implications of biased pain-related interpretations in pain-free individuals, which may shed light on processes of transition from a pain-free state to acute pain, and acute pain to chronic pain. The primary aim of the main study detailed in this protocol is to investigate the effects of pain-related cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) on the interpretation of ambiguous somatosensory stimuli. When deciding the point at which to report their level of pain threshold and tolerance, participants must by necessity interpret somatosensory sensations. Sensations around the pain threshold are likely to be ambiguously painful, sometimes interpreted as painful and sometimes not, which has been proposed as a zone of uncertainty. A pilot study was first conducted to test whether the proposed experimental design is feasible and appropriate, and to ascertain study effect sizes. Eighteen healthy participants were randomised to complete either benign CBM-I (trained towards neutral interpretations of ambiguous scenarios; n =\u2009 9) or pain CBM-I (trained towards pain-related interpretations of ambiguous scenarios; n =\u2009 9). The Ambiguous Scenarios Task was used to train interpretation biases, and a novel Interpretation of Somatosensory Sensations Assessment was used to explore interpretation of ambiguous somatosensory sensations around the individual’s pain threshold. Participants receiving pain CBM-I, compared to those receiving benign CBM-I, had higher pain-related interpretation bias scores on the test phase of the Ambiguous Scenarios Task with a large effect size, and showed higher intensity and unpleasantness ratings on the Interpretation of Somatosensory Sensations Assessment typically with medium to large effect sizes. These paradigms are suitable for a full-scale investigation. Modifications made to the experimental design based on insights from the pilot study are discussed. This research extends beyond pain patient populations to researchers and clinicians working with other conditions, especially anxiety and mood disorders where patients may misinterpret or catastrophize ambiguous bodily sensations.']",public,['20(4):e0318296'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnJvYWRiZW50LCBQaGlsaXBwYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Broadbent, Philippa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlvc3NpLCBDaHJpc3RpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Liossi, Christina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9144-8067', 'prefLabel': 'Schoth, Daniel'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A protocol for an experimental investigation of the effects of pain-related interpretation bias modification on interpretation of ambiguous somatosensory and linguistic stimuli in healthy individuals'],2025-04-08T14:09:50.501+0200,337.0

This study aimed to investigate the impact of opioid use on the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing alloHCT. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by merging data from our local transplant database with anonymized pharmacy records obtained from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). We analyzed 681 patients who underwent alloHCT at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between January 2010 and December 2019. Patients who initiated opioid use within one-year post-alloHCT and had opioid prescriptions for more than 30 days were categorized as intense opioid users (IOU). Additionally, patients who started opioids before or within one-year post-alloHCT and had opioid prescriptions for less than 30 days but died while on opioids were also classified as IOU. The analytical code used for the analysis is available in the Supporting Information file. RESULTS: Among the 681 patients, 51 were identified as IOU. The two-year overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in the IOU group, with 29.4% survival compared to 53% in non-IOU (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.26–2.48, p\u2009=\u20090.0008). Multivariate analysis indicated that IOU status was associated with a 2.32 times higher instantaneous rate of death compared to non-IOU (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.5–3.5, p\u2009=\u20090.002). The median time for relapse was 147 days in the IOU group (range 52–393) and 209 day for non-IOU (range 96–1793), p\u2009=\u20090.0082. Furthermore, the relapse rate at two years was notably higher in the IOU group (31.4% vs. 16.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.0049). The analysis of factors independently associated with relapse-free survival (LFS) showed that IOU status, age, donor type, and cytogenetic risk were significant predictors. At two years, relapse-free survival was 29.4% in the IOU group compared to 52.5% in the non-IOU group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found a correlation between intense opioid use in alloHCT patients and worse overall survival, particularly concerning higher relapse rates.

This study aimed to examine whether people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (PwMS) differ from healthy control individuals (HC) in their performance on different tasks related to facial emotion processing. METHODS: In a cross-sectional controlled study, 30 PwMS and 35 HC completed a baseline neuropsychological evaluation and experimental tasks assessing visual exploration of facial stimuli through eye tracking, facial emotion recognition, and facial memory recognition. The facial stimuli displayed either a neutral expression or an emotion (happiness, fear, or disgust). RESULTS: PwMS and HC performed comparably in facial emotion recognition. In facial memory recognition, HC were significantly more accurate in recognizing previously seen fearful faces compared to neutral faces (Wilcoxon test, Z\u2009=\u2009-2.26, P\u2009=\u20090.024), demonstrating emotional enhancement of memory. In contrast, PwMS did not exhibit a memory advantage for fearful faces over neutral faces (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Groups also differed in the eye-tracking task. In all but one condition (disgust), PwMS showed a significantly greater tendency to explore the eye area rather than the mouth area compared to HC. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in visual exploration and a lack of emotional enhancement of memory are observed in PwMS, who otherwise demonstrate intact facial emotion recognition. These results suggest altered emotion-cognition interactions in PwMS. Early detection of subtle changes and targeted interventions may help prevent future debilitating impairments in social functioning.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0319967'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29ldHRmcmllZCwgRWxpc2FiZXRo', 'prefLabel': 'Goettfried, Elisabeth'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6909-6109', 'prefLabel': 'Barket, Robert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVyc2htYW4sIFJvbmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Hershman, Ronen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVsYXplciwgTWFyZ2FyZXRl', 'prefLabel': 'Delazer, Margarete'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXVlciwgTWljaGFlbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Auer, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2755-2043', 'prefLabel': 'Berek, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWxsbWVyZXIsIFBoaWxpcHA=', 'prefLabel': 'Ellmerer, Philipp'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5699-9077', 'prefLabel': 'Seebacher, Barbara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVnZW4sIEhhcmFsZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Hegen, Harald'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGkgUGF1bGksIEZyYW56aXNrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Di Pauli, Franziska'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4541-8841', 'prefLabel': 'Deisenhammer, Florian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1640-4179', 'prefLabel': 'Zamarian, Laura'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Face exploration, emotion recognition, and emotional enhancement of memory in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis']",2025-04-08T13:35:52.399+0200,337.0
frl:6511236,"['Conventional expression studies quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels gene-by-gene. We recently showed that protein expression is modulated at a global scale by amino acid availability, suggesting that mRNA expression levels might be equivalently affected. Through re-analysis of public transcriptomic datasets, it was confirmed that nucleobase supply interacts with the specific demands of mRNA A\u2009+\u2009U:C\u2009+\u2009G sequence composition to shape a global profile of expression, which can be quantified as a gradient of average expression change by average composition change. In mammals, each separate organ and cell-type displays a distinct baseline profile of global expression. These profiles can shift dynamically across the circadian day and the menstrual cycle. They are also significantly distorted by viral infection, multiple complex genetic disorders (including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autoimmune disorders), and after treatment with 115 of the 597 chemical entities analysed. These included known toxins and nucleobase analogues, but also many commonly prescribed medications such as antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors, thus revealing a new mechanism of drug action and side-effect. As well as key roles in disease susceptibility, mRNAs with extreme compositions are significantly over-represented in gene ontologies such as transcription and cell division, making these processes particularly sensitive to swings in global expression. This may permit efficient, en bloc transcriptional reprogramming of cell state through simple adjustment of nucleobase proportion and supply. It is also proposed that this mechanism helped mitigate the loss of essential amino acid synthesis in higher organisms. In summary, global expression regulation is invisible to conventional transcriptomic analysis, but its measurement allows a useful distinction between active, promoter-mediated gene expression changes and passive, cell state-dependent transcriptional competence. Linking cell metabolism directly to gene expression offers an entirely new perspective on evolution, disease aetiopathology (including gene x environment - GxE - interactions), and the nature of the pharmacological response.']",public,['20(5):e0317071'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2374-6329', 'prefLabel': 'Pickard, Benjamin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A mechanism of global gene expression regulation is disrupted by multiple disease states and drug treatments'],2025-05-09T09:17:05.870+0200,337.0
frl:6511286,"['INTRODUCTION: Patient experience of interprofessional collaboration in primary care has been well-studied but not in specialist clinics. Our qualitative study aimed to understand patients’ experience of a nurse-doctor collaboration at three specialist clinics (Epilepsy Clinic, Neuroimmunology Clinic, and Persistent Concussion Clinic) in a tertiary neurology care centre in Singapore. METHODOLOGY: Between December 2023 and April 2024, participants of different demographic and disease profiles from the three specialist clinics were recruited using maximum variation selection. We generated observation and interview data to understand patient experience in a multifaceted and in-depth manner. We analyzed the data using Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We observed 27 patients, of whom 12 agreed to be interviewed. We constructed two themes. The first discussed the patients’ varied receptivity to interprofessional collaboration depending on their perceived healthcare needs. Most patients valued collaborative care as it saved time and enhanced their access to psychosocial and financial support. However, patients whose disease status was still active preferred to consult the doctors for symptomatic management through drug treatment. They were observed to be reticent about sharing their preference with the care team. The second theme examined the absence of formal introduction of the concept of interprofessional collaboration to the patients. Some patients appeared to be unaware that specialist nurses were qualified to collaborate with doctors, and this lowered their perceptions of the nurses’ competence and seemingly weakened their receptivity to IPC. CONCLUSION: Patients’ experience of IPC at specialist clinics varied depending on patients’ perceived healthcare needs. To optimize patients’ receptivity to IPC, the provision of collaborative care should be calibrated to fulfill different patients’ perceived and actual healthcare needs. Doing so may optimize the value of collaborative care to patients. Further enhancements to patients’ receptivity would involve the intentional effort to prepare patients for collaborative practice.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0321192'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1968-9202', 'prefLabel': 'foo, yang yann'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGluLCBYaWFvaHVp', 'prefLabel': 'Xin, Xiaohui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbmcsIFFpYW5odWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Cheng, Qianhui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T25nLCBId2VlIEt1YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ong, Hwee Kuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWVvaCwgVGluZyBUaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Yeoh, Ting Ting'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-2637', 'prefLabel': 'ZHOU, Wentao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFobWF0LCBTaXRpIFJvaGFpZGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Rahmat, Siti Rohaida'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuLCBOaWdlbCBDLksu', 'prefLabel': 'Tan, Nigel C.K.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmFvLCBKYWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Rao, Jai'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJlZW1hbiwgS2lyc3R5IEou', 'prefLabel': 'Freeman, Kirsty J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGltLCBTb2sgTXVp', 'prefLabel': 'Lim, Sok Mui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuLCBLZXZpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Tan, Kevin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['How patients experience nurse-doctor collaborative care at specialist clinics: A qualitative study'],2025-05-12T14:06:48.122+0200,337.0

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov, to identify studies investigating ATG in T1D in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for randomized clinical trials and case-control studies were used to assess the quality and evaluate the risk of bias in the eligible studies. RESULTS: The primary outcomes assessed were preservation of C-peptide levels, glycemic control, and adverse events. Results indicated that ATG showed potential in preserving beta-cell function and improving clinical outcomes in recent-onset T1D. However, the incidence of adverse events, such as cytokine release syndrome and lymphopenia, necessitated careful monitoring and management. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ATG presents a promising therapeutic approach for modifying the progression of T1D. While early-phase trials demonstrate potential benefits in preserving beta-cell function, further large-scale, long-term studies are essential to establish optimal dosing regimens, long-term efficacy, and safety profiles. This review highlights the importance of continued research to fully elucidate the role of ATG in T1D management.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0323642'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0894-237X', 'prefLabel': 'Mittal, Rahul'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0302-7036', 'prefLabel': 'McKenna, Keelin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8211-1617', 'prefLabel': 'Lemos, Joana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SnVuZWphLCBTaHJleWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Juneja, Shreya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWl0dGFsLCBNYW5uYXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Mittal, Mannat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlyYW5pLCBLaGVtcmFq', 'prefLabel': 'Hirani, Khemraj'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Therapeutic potential of anti-thymocyte globulin in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review'],2025-05-14T14:13:03.036+0200,337.0
frl:6511394,"['BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men, and accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules at an early stage is crucial for optimizing treatment. Multimodal imaging (such as ADC and T2) plays an important role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but effectively combining these imaging features for accurate classification remains a challenge. METHODS: This retrospective study included MRI data from 199 prostate cancer patients. Radiomic features from both the tumor and peritumoral regions were extracted, and a random forest model was used to select the most contributive features for classification. Three machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Trees—were then constructed and trained on four different feature combinations (tumor ADC, tumor T2, tumor ADC+T2, and tumor\u2009+\u2009peritumoral ADC+T2). RESULTS: The model incorporating multimodal imaging features and peritumoral characteristics showed superior classification performance. The Extra Trees model outperformed the others across all feature combinations, particularly in the tumor\u2009+\u2009peritumoral ADC+T2 group, where the AUC reached 0.729. The AUC values for the other combinations also exceeded 0.65. While the Random Forest and XGBoost models performed slightly lower, they still demonstrated strong classification abilities, with AUCs ranging from 0.63 to 0.72. SHAP analysis revealed that key features, such as tumor texture and peritumoral gray-level features, significantly contributed to the model’s classification decisions. CONCLUSION: The combination of multimodal imaging data with peritumoral features moderately improved the accuracy of prostate cancer classification. This model provides a non-invasive and effective diagnostic tool for clinical use and supports future personalized treatment decisions.\r\n']",public,['20(5):e0323752'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvdSwgSHVhZGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Huadi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGllLCBNZWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Xie, Mei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpLCBIZW1pYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Shi, Hemiao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hvdSwgQ2hlbmhhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Shou, Chenhan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuZywgTWVuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Tang, Meng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFl1ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Yue'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIFl1ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Yue'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-9910-3185', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Xiao'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Integrating multimodal imaging and peritumoral features for enhanced prostate cancer diagnosis: A machine learning approach'],2025-05-16T13:57:00.837+0200,337.0

The immunogenicity and impact of each HLA-DQ mismatch on graft outcomes can vary considerably. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study investigated the prevalence and risk factors for dnDSA development in patients who underwent KT at Siriraj Hospital between 2006 and 2020 and had HLA-DQB1 mismatches. Our center employed a protocol for post-KT dnDSA surveillance. The impact of dnDSAs on late rejection and graft survival was evaluated. RESULTS: In our cohort of 491 KT recipients, 59 (12.02%) developed dnDSAs to HLA-DQB1 at a median time of 4.2 years after KT. The risk of dnDSA occurrence was significantly higher among recipients with HLA-DQ7 mismatch (HR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.21–6.52; P = 0.017) and HLA-DQ9 mismatch (HR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.11–6.27; P = 0.028). Recipients who developed dnDSAs were younger (P = 0.009), had higher rates of medication nonadherence (P = 0.031), had pre-KT panel reactive antibody levels above 20% (P = 0.044), and received non-tacrolimus immunosuppression (P < 0.001) compared to those without. Recipients who developed dnDSAs to HLA-DQ exhibited a significantly higher incidence of late graft rejection (HR: 7.76; 95% CI: 5–12.03; P < 0.0001) and inferior death-censored graft survival than those without dnDSAs (log rank P < 0.001).

The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to estimate cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) between stage T1-2N0M0 SCLC patients undergoing sublobar resection and those receiving lobectomy. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were included in the analysis, with 64 undergoing sublobar resection and 121 receiving lobectomy. Before propensity score matching, lobectomy was associated with significantly better CSS (hazard ratio [HR] =, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32, P = 0.006) and OS (HR =, 95% CI: 0.39, P = 0.005) compared to sublobar resection.

Ceramides are formed from the degradation of sphingolipids in cell membranes and play an important role in signaling and modulating biological processes. There is evidence that omega-3 fatty acid administration can act on this pathway. To evaluate the role of the ceramide pathway in the pathophysiology of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the attenuation of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control (C), Doxorubicin (D), Omega-3 fatty acids (W), and Doxorubicin + Omega-3 fatty acids (DW). The groups received omega-3 fatty acids (400\u2009mg/kg/day, via gavage) or water for 6\u2009weeks and doxorubicin (3.5\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or saline once a week for 4\u2009weeks. Doxorubicin-treated animals showed increases in left atrium and left ventricle diameters, serum triglycerides and cholesterol, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonylation. We also observed a decrease in left ventricular shortening fraction and nSMase1 expression in the heart. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation attenuated the structural and functional alterations caused by doxorubicin and decreased protein carbonylation. In contrast to doxorubicin, omega-3 fatty acids increased neutral nSMase activity in animals that both received and did not receive doxorubicin but with no effect on nSMase1 protein expression. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation attenuated the cardiotoxicity caused by doxorubicin. The ceramide pathway may be involved in the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity, but it is not the mechanism by which omega-3 fatty acids attenuated cardiac dysfunction.']",public,['12(11):9198-9211'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4060-870X', 'prefLabel': 'Gaiato Monte, Marina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9ub24sIENhcm9saW5hIFJvZHJpZ3Vlcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Tonon, Carolina Rodrigues'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnVqaW1vcmksIEFuZGVyc29uIFNlaWpp', 'prefLabel': 'Fujimori, Anderson Seiji'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmliZWlybywgQW5hIFBhdWxhIERhbnRhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Ribeiro, Ana Paula Dantas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmFuYXRpLCBTaWxtZWlhIEdhcmNpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zanati, Silmeia Garcia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T2tvc2hpLCBLYXRhc2hp', 'prefLabel': 'Okoshi, Katashi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FtYWNobywgQ2FtaWxhIFJlbmF0YSBDb3JyZWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Camacho, Camila Renata Correa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZXR0bywgTWFyaWEgUmVnaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Moretto, Maria Regina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFpdmEsIFNlcmdpbyBBbGJlcnRvIFJ1cHA=', 'prefLabel': 'Paiva, Sergio Alberto Rupp'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wm9ybm9mZiwgTGVvbmFyZG8gQW50b25pbyBNYW1lZGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Zornoff, Leonardo Antonio Mamede'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXpldmVkbywgUGF1bGEgU2NobWlkdA==', 'prefLabel': 'Azevedo, Paula Schmidt'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWluaWN1Y2NpLCBNYXJjb3MgRmVycmVpcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Minicucci, Marcos Ferreira'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2875-9532', 'prefLabel': 'Polegato, Bertha'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Omega-3 supplementation attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity but is not related to the ceramide pathway'],2025-04-16T12:06:27.519+0200,286.0

However, information on grain magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) status and their response to phosphorus (P) fertilization in sweet corn is still insufficient. In the current study, we combined the genotype evaluation and P gradient experiments to investigate how P supply influences the spatio-temporal variation of grain mineral nutrition (Mg and Ca) and their bioavailabilities in sweet corn. Increasing P decreased grain Ca by 16.7%, from 0.18 to 0.15\u2009g\u2009kg−1, but increased phytic acid phosphorus (PAP) concentration by 7.4%. Optimal P levels increased grain Mg concentration by 14.7%, from 1.36 to a peak of 1.56\u2009g\u2009kg−1; however, excessive P reduced it by 3.8% to 1.50\u2009g\u2009kg−1. Spatially, optimal P increased the grain Mg concentration across all cob positions and in the germ, with the largest variation observed at the upside position (Coefficient of variation (cv)\u2009=\u200911.88%). Conversely, high P decreased Mg concentration in middle-cob grains and the germ. High P also reduced Ca in the upper/middle-cob grain and in both germ and endosperm. P consistently increased grain PAP but reduced Mg and Ca bioavailability across all growth stages, all grain fractions, and the middle/bottom cob positions. Notably, PAP showed the largest variation at the late growth stage in bottom cob grains (CV\u2009=\u20098.75%). Mg and Ca bioavailabilities exhibited significant variations, primarily in upper grains during the early filling stage, with CVs reaching 14.5% and 43.23%, respectively. Temporally, early grain growth stage was more sensitive to P-induced changes in Mg, Ca and their bioavailabilities, while later growth stage was more responsive to grain PAP alterations. These findings suggest that reducing P input can be advantageous for achieving high Mg and Ca biofortified sweet corn grain.']",public,['13(1):e4725'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3597-0640', 'prefLabel': 'su, da'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmluLCBaaGl5YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jin, Zhiya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T3UsIEppZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Ou, Jie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVuZWVyLCBNdWhhbW1hZCBBdGlm', 'prefLabel': 'Muneer, Muhammad Atif'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhbmcsIFl1bmZlaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jiang, Yunfei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWUsIERlbGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ye, Delian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIExpYW5ncXVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Liangquan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuLCBYaWFvanVu', 'prefLabel': 'Yan, Xiaojun'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Spatial–Temporal Variation of Grain Magnesium, Calcium and Their Response to Phosphorus Nutrition in Sweet Corn']",2025-07-22T13:03:41.308+0200,286.0

Recent studies highlight the potential role of synbiotics—combinations of probiotics and prebiotics—in modulating the microbiota and supporting immune responses. The authors of this study aimed to evaluate the impact of oral synbiotic supplementation on the sinus microbiota in patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for CRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 425 adult patients with CRS were enrolled in a multicenter retrospective study. According to EPOS 2020 guidelines, participants qualified for ESS. The intervention group (n = 194) received a synbiotic preparation for 6–8 weeks before and after surgery; the control group (n = 231) received no supplementation. Intraoperative and follow-up bacteriological samples were collected and analyzed. Statistical analysis included chi-square, t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, and ANOVA models. RESULTS: Patients receiving synbiotics showed a significant reduction in pathogenic bacterial colonies postoperatively compared to the control group. In the synbiotic group coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared more frequently. Patients in the synbiotic group required significantly less postoperative antibiotic therapy (p < 0.05). Both groups exhibited an increase in Gram-positive and physiological flora and a decrease in Gram-negative bacteria following ESS. CONCLUSIONS: Synbiotic supplementation may beneficially influence the composition of the sinus microbiota and reduce pathogenic bacterial colonization following ESS.

We therefore aimed to investigate the prospective associations of objectively measured FAs with CVD, including incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as CVD mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating FA concentrations expressed as the percentage of total FAs were assayed in 172 891 participants without prior vascular disease at baseline from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-CVD (EPIC-CVD) (7343 CHD; 6499 stroke), UK Biobank (1825; 1474), and INTERVAL (285; 209) cohort studies. Hazard ratio (HR) per 1-standard deviation (SD) higher FA concentrations was estimated using Cox regression models and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis published by 6 May 2023 on associations between FAs and CVDs were systematically searched and updated meta-analyses using random-effects model were conducted. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was also summarized. Higher concentrations of total saturated FAs (SFAs) were associated with higher cardiovascular risks in the combined analysis, with differential findings noted for SFA sub-types in further analysis restricted to EPIC-CVD: positive associations for even-chain SFA [HR for CHD 1.24 (95% CI: 1.18–1.32); stroke 1.23 (1.10–1.38)] and negative associations for odd-chain [0.82 (0.76–0.87); 0.73 (0.67–0.78)] and longer-chain [0.95 (0.80–1.12); 0.84 (0.72–0.99)] SFA. In the combined analysis, total n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) [0.91 (0.85–0.97)], including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [0.91 (0.84–0.98)], was negatively associated with incident CHD risk. Similarly, total n-6 PUFA [0.94 (0.91–0.98)], including linoleic acid (LA) [0.89 (0.83–0.95)], was negatively associated with incident stroke risk. In contrast, more detailed analyses in EPIC-CVD revealed that several downstream n-6 PUFAs of LA were positively associated with CHD risk. Updated meta-analyses of 37 FAs including 49 non-overlapping studies, involving between 7787 and 22 802 CHD cases and between 6499 and 14 221 stroke cases, showed broadly similar results as our combined empirical analysis and further suggested significant inverse associations of individual long-chain n-3 PUFAs and LA on both CHD and stroke. The findings of long-chain n-3 PUFAs were consistent with those from published RCTs on CHD despite insufficient evidence in monotherapy, while RCT evidence remained unclear for the rest of the explored FAs. CONCLUSION: Our study provides an overview of the most recent evidence on the associations between objectively measured FAs and CVD outcomes. Collectively, the data reveal notable differences in associations by SFA sub-types and call for further studies, especially RCTs, to explore these links.']",public,['32(3):233-246'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpLCBGYW5jaGFv', 'prefLabel': 'Shi, Fanchao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hvd2RodXJ5LCBSYWppdg==', 'prefLabel': 'Chowdhury, Rajiv'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29maWFub3BvdWxvdSwgRWxlbmk=', 'prefLabel': 'Sofianopoulou, Eleni'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9998-051X', 'prefLabel': 'Koulman, Albert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VuLCBMdWFubHVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Sun, Luanluan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RldXIsIE1hcmlua2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Steur, Marinka'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1275-1827', 'prefLabel': 'Aleksandrova, Krasimira'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0481-2893', 'prefLabel': 'Dahm, Christina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6ZSwgTWF0dGhpYXMgQg==', 'prefLabel': 'Schulze, Matthias B'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIGRlciBTaG91dywgWXZvbm5lIFQ=', 'prefLabel': 'van der Shouw, Yvonne T'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4472-1179', 'prefLabel': 'Agnoli, Claudia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1pYW5vLCBQaWxhcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Amiano, Pilar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9lciwgSm9sYW5kYSBNIEE=', 'prefLabel': 'Boer, Jolanda M A'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9yaywgQ2hyaXN0aWFuIFM=', 'prefLabel': 'Bork, Christian S'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FicmVyYS1DYXN0cm8sIE5hdGFsaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Cabrera-Castro, Natalia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWljaGVsbWFubiwgRmFiaWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Eichelmann, Fabian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9724-5490', 'prefLabel': 'Elbaz, Alexis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmFycsOgcywgTWFydGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Farràs, Marta'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6517-1300', 'prefLabel': 'Heath, Alicia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3751-3929', 'prefLabel': 'Kaaks, Rudolf'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-6555', 'prefLabel': 'Katzke, Verena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2Vza2ktUmFoa29uZW4sIFBla2th', 'prefLabel': 'Keski-Rahkonen, Pekka'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5758-9069', 'prefLabel': 'Masala, Giovanna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZW5vLUlyaWJhcywgQ29uY2hp', 'prefLabel': 'Moreno-Iribas, Conchi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFuaWNvLCBTYWx2YXRvcmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Panico, Salvatore'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4102-6835', 'prefLabel': 'Papier, Keren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0cm92YSwgRGFmaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Petrova, Dafina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UXVpcsOzcywgSiBSYW3Ds24=', 'prefLabel': 'Quirós, J Ramón'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8749-9737', 'prefLabel': 'RICCERI, FULVIO'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2V2ZXJpLCBHaWFubHVjYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Severi, Gianluca'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4385-2097', 'prefLabel': 'Tjonneland, Anne'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9uZywgVGFtbXkgWSBO', 'prefLabel': 'Tong, Tammy Y N'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2666-414X', 'prefLabel': 'tumino, rosario'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FyZWhhbSwgTmljaG9sYXMgSg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wareham, Nicholas J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VpZGVycGFzcywgRWxpc2FiZXRl', 'prefLabel': 'Weiderpass, Elisabete'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8776-6719', 'prefLabel': 'Di Angelantonio, Emanuele'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5041-248X', 'prefLabel': 'Forouhi, Nita'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFuZXNoLCBKb2hu', 'prefLabel': 'Danesh, John'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnV0dGVyd29ydGgsIEFkYW0gUw==', 'prefLabel': 'Butterworth, Adam S'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1155-4872', 'prefLabel': 'Kaptoge, Stephen'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Association of circulating fatty acids with cardiovascular disease risk: Analysis of individual-level data in three large prospective cohorts and updated meta-analysis'],2025-06-25T15:07:37.652+0200,266.0
frl:6509983,"['Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by changes in appetite and body weight as well as blunted reward sensitivity (‘anhedonia’). However, it is not well understood which mechanisms are driving changes in reward sensitivity, specifically regarding food. Here, we used a sample of 117 participants (54 patients with MDD and 63 healthy control participants [HCPs]) who completed a food cue reactivity task with ratings of wanting and liking for 60 food and 20 non-food items. To evaluate which components of the food may contribute to altered ratings in depression, we tested for associations with macronutrients of the depicted items. In line with previous studies, we found reduced ratings of food wanting (p = .003) but not liking (p = .23) in patients with MDD compared to matched HCPs. Adding macronutrient composition to the models of wanting and liking substantially improved their fit (ps < .001). Compared to carbohydrate-rich foods, patients with MDD reported lower liking and wanting ratings for high-fat and high-protein foods. Moreover, patients with MDD showed weaker correlations in their preferences for carbohydrate- versus fat- or protein-rich foods (ps < .001), pointing to potential disturbances in metabolic signaling. To conclude, our results suggest that depression-related alterations in food reward ratings are more specific to the macronutrient composition of the food than previously anticipated, hinting at disturbances in gut–brain signaling. These findings raise the intriguing question of whether interventions targeting the gut could help normalize aberrant reward signals for foods rich in fat or protein.

Royal Jelly (RJ) and tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) are suggested to promote obesity and its related problems through potential mutual mechanistic pathways. This investigation intended to evaluate the glycemic and inflammation-promoting effects of RJ, TRF, and their combinations to evaluate their synergic effects through irisin action in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) that underwent a calorie restriction diet (CRD). Fifty HFD-fed obese rats received the following interventions: RJ, TRF, or RJ\u2009+\u2009TRF in combination with a CRD for eight consecutive weeks. After the investigation, body weight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), irisin, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), leptin, adiponectin, and insulin resistance (IR) were assessed. After 8\u2009weeks of treatment, significant weight reduction was noticed in rats that received RJ and RJ\u2009+\u2009TRF related to the CRD rats (p\u2009<\u2009.001), although this reduction was not considerable in TRF-treated rats. RJ and RJ\u2009+\u2009TRF supplementation markedly elevated irisin concentrations in CRD rats (p\u2009<\u2009.05), but TRF did not. Glycemic indices, inflammatory indices including IL-1β and CRP levels, and leptin concentrations were significantly decreased after RJ, TRF, and their combinations were added to CRD (p\u2009<\u2009.05). According to the mediational analysis results, irisin mediated the promoting effects of RJ on glycemic hemostasis. Based on the results of this investigation, RJ and TRF are novel nutrients that have the potential to improve obesity-related disorders.

Altogether, we accepted 85 cases and 3350 controls, of which we interviewed 77 cases and 2071 population controls about constitutional factors, medical examinations, and former diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Medical examinations with X-ray or radiotherapy performed >20 times at least one year before the thymoma diagnosis indicated a possible risk factor for thymoma (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.93–2.69). Having the first radiotherapy treatment at least one year before the thymoma diagnosis yielded an OR for thymoma of 2.39; 95% CI (0.96–5.99), and if it was at least five years before, the OR for thymoma was 2.81; 95% CI (1.03–7.72).

Over twenty instances of X-ray examinations or radiotherapy were identified as potential risk factors for thymoma, along with certain constitutional factors. The observed correlations between benign tumours and thymoma could stem from an inherent predisposition to tumour development or result from detection bias.

frl:6511217,"[""The cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis posits that individuals can differ in how their brain function is disrupted by pathology associated with aging and neurodegeneration. Here, we test this hypothesis in the continuum from cognitively normal to at-risk stages for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to AD dementia using longitudinal data from 490 participants of the DELCODE multicentric observational study. Brain function is measured using task fMRI of visual memory encoding. Using a multivariate moderation analysis, we identify a CR-related activity pattern underlying successful memory encoding that moderates the detrimental effect of AD pathological load on cognitive performance. CR is mainly represented by a more pronounced expression of the task-active network encompassing deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) and activation of inferior temporal regions including the fusiform gyrus. We devise personalized fMRI-based CR scores that moderate the impact of AD pathology on cognitive performance and are positively associated with years of education. Furthermore, higher CR scores attenuate the effect of AD pathology on cognitive decline over time.

This systematic review with meta-analysis explored the modifiable determinants of adolescents’ device-based PA and/or sedentary behaviour (SB), evaluated in previous interventions and examined the associations between PA/SB and these determinants in settings. METHODS: A search was conducted on five electronic databases, including papers published from January 2010 to July 2023. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) or Controlled Trials (CTs) measuring adolescents’ device-based PA/SB and their modifiable determinants at least at two time points: pre- and post-intervention were considered eligible. PA/SB and determinants were the main outcomes. Modifiable determinants were classified after data extraction adopting the social-ecological perspective. Robust Bayesian meta-analyses (RoBMA) were performed per each study setting. Outcomes identified in only one study were presented narratively. The risk of bias for each study and the certainty of the evidence for each meta-analysis were evaluated. The publication bias was also checked. PROSPERO ID: CRD42021282874. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs (eight in school, three in school and family, and one in the family setting) and one CT (in the school setting) were included. Fifty-four modifiable determinants were identified and were combined into 33 broader determinants (21 individual–psychological, four individual–behavioural, seven interpersonal, and one institutional). RoBMAs revealed none or negligible pooled intervention effects on PA/SB or determinants in all settings. The certainty of the evidence of the impact of interventions on outcomes ranged from very low to low. Narratively, intervention effects in favour of the experimental group were detected in school setting for the determinants: knowledge of the environment for practicing PA, d\u2009=\u20091.84, 95%CI (1.48, 2.20), behaviour change techniques, d\u2009=\u20090.90, 95%CI (0.09, 1.70), choice provided, d\u2009=\u20090.70, 95%CI (0.36, 1.03), but no corresponding effects on PA or SB were found. CONCLUSIONS: Weak to minimal evidence regarding the associations between the identified modifiable determinants and adolescents’ device-based PA/SB in settings were found, probably due to intervention ineffectiveness. Well-designed and well-implemented multicomponent interventions should further explore the variety of modifiable determinants of adolescents’ PA/SB, including policy and environmental variables.']",public,['24(1):1706'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29sb3ZlbG9uaXMsIEF0aGFuYXNpb3M=', 'prefLabel': 'Kolovelonis, Athanasios'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3lybXBhcywgSW9hbm5pcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Syrmpas, Ioannis'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFyY3V6emksIEFubmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Marcuzzi, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2h1ZGFpciwgTW9oYW1tZWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Khudair, Mohammed'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmcsIEt3b2s=', 'prefLabel': 'Ng, Kwok'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGVtcGVzdCwgR2F2aW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Tempest, Gavin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVyaWMsIFJhdGtv', 'prefLabel': 'Peric, Ratko'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFydG9zLCBGcmFudGnFoWVr', 'prefLabel': 'Bartos, František'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFpZXIsIE1heGltaWxpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Maier, Maximilian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2926-4758', 'prefLabel': 'Brandes, Mirko'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FybGluLCBBbmdlbGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Carlin, Angela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2lhY2Npb25pLCBTaW1vbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Ciaccioni, Simone'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29ydGlzLCBDcmlzdGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cortis, Cristina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q29ydmlubywgQ2hpYXJh', 'prefLabel': 'Corvino, Chiara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGkgQ3JlZGljbywgQW5kcmVh', 'prefLabel': 'Di Credico, Andrea'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHJpZCwgUGF0cmlr', 'prefLabel': 'Drid, Patrik'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FsbMOoLCBGcmFuY2VzY2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Gallè, Francesca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXp6aWN1cG8sIFBhc2NhbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Izzicupo, Pascal'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFocmUsIEhlbnJpZXR0ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jahre, Henriette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29uZ3N2b2xkLCBBdGxl', 'prefLabel': 'Kongsvold, Atle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S291aWRpLCBFdmFuZ2VsaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Kouidi, Evangelia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yaywgUGF1bCBKYXJsZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Mork, Paul Jarle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFsdW1ibywgRmVkZXJpY28=', 'prefLabel': 'Palumbo, Federico'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVtYm9sZCwgUGVubnkgTG91aXNlIFNoZWVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Rumbold, Penny Louise Sheena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FuZHUsIFBldHJ1', 'prefLabel': 'Sandu, Petru'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3Rhdm5zYm8sIE1ldHRl', 'prefLabel': 'Stavnsbo, Mette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlsZWxhLCBTb2ZpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Vilela, Sofia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29vZHMsIENhdGhlcmluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Woods, Catherine'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3Vuc2NoLCBLYXRocmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Wunsch, Kathrin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FwcmFuaWNhLCBMYXVyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Capranica, Laura'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFjRG9ubmNoYSwgQ2lhcmFu', 'prefLabel': 'MacDonncha, Ciaran'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGluZywgRmlvbmEgQ2h1biBNYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ling, Fiona Chun Man'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['DE-PASS best evidence statement (BESt): determinants of adolescents’ device-based physical activity and sedentary behaviour in settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis'],2025-01-24T12:12:35.552+0100,266.0

As not all patients respond to ICI immunotherapy, imaging biomarkers are required to accurately monitor early response to therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles for monitoring the effects of combined anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in a murine melanoma model.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nMurine melanoma allografts (B16-F10) were implanted subcutaneously in n\u2009=\u200910 therapy and n\u2009=\u200910 control female C57BL/6 mice. CEUS with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles was performed on day 7 and 12. The therapy group received 3 intraperitoneal injections on days 7, 9, 11 of combined anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, the control group received a placebo. CEUS assessed tumour perfusion during an early vascular phase (wash-in area under the curve\u2009=\u2009WiAUC) and VEGFR2-specific binding during a late molecular phase (signal intensity at 8 minutes (SI8min) and 10 minutes (SI10min)). For pathophysiological validation immunohistochemistry was performed.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAt follow-up, the CEUS perfusion parameter WiAUC demonstrated a significantly higher decrease in the therapy than in the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.021). At follow-up, the signal enhancement in the late phase was significantly lower in the therapy than in the control group (SI8min p\u2009=\u20090.003; SI10min p\u2009=\u20090.002). Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more apoptotic tumour cells (p\u2009=\u20090.001), more tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p\u2009=\u20090.049), lower tumour cell proliferation (p\u2009=\u20090.001), lower microvascular density (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and lower VEGFR2 expression (p\u2009=\u20090.003) in the therapy than in the control group.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nCEUS with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles allowed for monitoring early treatment effects of a combined anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy on melanoma allografts with significantly lower tumour perfusion and significantly lower binding of VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles in the therapy than in the control group.\r\n']",public,[' 20(7):e0326675'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-0835-0328', 'prefLabel': ', Felix'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW50b25zLCBNZWxpc3NhIEou', 'prefLabel': 'Antons, Melissa J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qmx1bWUsIExhcmlzc2EgVi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Blume, Larissa V.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGlybmVyLUVwcGVuZWRlciwgSGVpZHJ1bg==', 'prefLabel': 'Hirner-Eppeneder, Heidrun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xvaWJlci1MYW5naG9yc3QsIFNhbmRyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kloiber-Langhorst, Sandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2ltaWMsIEFtcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Cimic, Amra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3R1ZWNrbCwgSmVubmlmZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Stueckl, Jennifer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFyZHksIElzYWJlbGxl', 'prefLabel': 'Tardy, Isabelle'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVya2FyZCwgVGFuamE=', 'prefLabel': 'Burkard, Tanja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Umlja2UsIEplbnM=', 'prefLabel': 'Ricke, Jens'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VueiwgV29sZmdhbmcgRy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Kunz, Wolfgang G.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2xldmVydCwgRGlyay1BbmRyZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Clevert, Dirk-Andre'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVpbWVyLCBNYXVyaWNlIE0u', 'prefLabel': 'Heimer, Maurice M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3lyYW4sIENsZW1lbnMgQy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Cyran, Clemens C.'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles for monitoring combined anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy effects in a murine melanoma model with immunohistochemical validation'],2025-07-14T14:26:04.746+0200,355.0

Alexithymia may influence the association between interoception and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to examine the role of alexithymia between interoception and depression. Eighty-eight depressed patients (DEPs) and fifty healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Interoceptive sensibility was assessed using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, and interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive awareness were evaluated through heartbeat counting tasks. Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. In the DEP group, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale. In DEPs, none of the three dimensions of interoception were associated with depressive symptoms. The alexithymic depressed patients exhibited lower interoceptive sensibility than their non-alexithymic counterparts, while the latter did not differ from the HC group. Moreover, alexithymia mediated the link between interoceptive sensibility and depressive symptoms. These results suggested that impaired interoceptive sensibility may primarily contribute to alexithymia, which, in turn, leads to depression.

Among them is the Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, which occupies high trophic levels and may be adversely affected by reduced food quantity or quality and consequent health impacts. In this study, we investigate the effects of habitat heterogeneity, individual heterozygosity and diet diversity on five different health indices (integument coloration, dietary antioxidants, haematocrit, body condition and parasite infection). The study was conducted in farmland areas of western Finland during a year of exceptionally low vole abundance. We found no obvious relationship between diet diversity and habitat heterogeneity. An interaction between diet diversity and individual heterozygosity in females suggested that diet specialists were able to maintain more intensely coloured integuments only if they had higher genetic diversity. In addition, more heterozygous females were less likely to be infected with Haemoproteus than females with lower individual genetic diversity.

Our results suggest that variation in individual quality and foraging ecology should be considered in conjunction with spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity to understand sex-specific variation in kestrel health.

Our study aimed to investigate the associations between early life factors and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children and adolescents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our analysis sample comprised of 8852 children aged 2–9 years at baseline that participated in up to three examination waves of the pan-European IDEFICS/I.Family cohort (baseline: 2007/08, 1st follow-up 2009/10, 2nd follow-up 2013/14). Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the associations between early life factors and MetS score and z-scores of waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides. Being born large for gestational age (LGA) showed a positive association with MetS score (β = 0.67; 99%CI 0.44, 0.90) and with WC z-score (β = 0.51; 99%CI 0.39, 0.63) and was weakly inversely associated with HDL z-score. Being born small for gestational age (SGA) was associated with lower WC z-score (ß = −0.26; 99%CI -0.37, −0.16), with a lower MetS score (ß = −0.13; 99%CI −0.33, 0.08) and slightly higher z-scores of SBP and DBP. Weight gain during pregnancy was positively associated with MetS score and WC z-score while premature birth was positively associated with SBP. CONCLUSIONS: Children born LGA, SGA or preterm may warrant closer monitoring to prevent MetS later on.']",public,['35(4):103808'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3801-4769', 'prefLabel': 'Günther, Kathrin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGZsw7xnZXIsIE1hcmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Pflüger, Maren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RWliZW4sIEdhYnJpZWxl', 'prefLabel': 'Eiben, Gabriele'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWFjb3ZpZWxsbywgTGljaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Iacoviello, Licia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlzc25lciwgTGF1cmVu', 'prefLabel': 'Lissner, Lauren'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcOlcmlsZCwgU3RhZmZhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Mårild, Staffan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9sbsOhciwgRMOpbmVz', 'prefLabel': 'Molnár, Dénes'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yZW5vLCBMdWlzIEE=', 'prefLabel': 'Moreno, Luis A'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVzc28sIFBhb2xh', 'prefLabel': 'Russo, Paola'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFwb3V0c291LCBTdGFsbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Papoutsou, Stalo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmVpZGViYXVtLCBUb29tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Veidebaum, Toomas'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/ZGUgSGVuYXV3LCBTdGVmYWFu', 'prefLabel': 'de Henauw, Stefaan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-570X', 'prefLabel': 'Ahrens, Wolfgang'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-2141', 'prefLabel': 'Wolters, Maike'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9004-1540', 'prefLabel': 'Börnhorst, Claudia'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Early life factors and later metabolic syndrome in European children and adolescents'],2025-07-03T09:41:57.765+0200,266.0
frl:6525129,"['BACKGROUND:\r\nMagnesium (Mg) is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including enzyme regulation, neuromuscular function, and cardiovascular health. Dysmagnesemia has been associated with arrhythmias, neuromuscular dysfunction, and poor outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, representing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. However, the relationship between dysmagnesemia and health outcomes in the ICU remains inadequately defined. \r\nAIM/OBJECTIVE: \r\nThis study aimed to assess the prevalence of dysmagnesemia and evaluate the correlation between total (tMg) and ionized magnesium (iMg) levels in a cohort of ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) patients. It also sought to evaluate patient characteristics and relevant health outcomes by comparing both concentrations of iMg and tMg.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThis prospective study was conducted among adult patients admitted to the ICU and the high dependency unit (HDU). RESULTS:\r\nAmong the 134 included patients, the median age was 63.5 years (IQR: 52.0–77.0). The majority, 91.0%, required mechanical ventilation. Additionally, 50.0% were diagnosed with diabetes, 28.4% had chronic kidney disease, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were administered to 67.2% of the patients. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia, as measured by iMg, was 6.7%, while hypermagnesemia was at 39.6%. When measured by tMg, hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia were observed at rates of 14.9% and 22.4%, respectively. The iMg measurements showed an association between the incidence of atrial fibrillation and hypomagnesemia (p = 0.015), whereas tMg measurements linked hypomagnesemia with longer hospital stays. Notably, only a few patients identified with iMg-measured hypomagnesemia received magnesium replacement during their ICU stay. \r\nCONCLUSIONS: \r\nDysmagnesemia is prevalent among critically ill patients, with discordance between iMg and tMg measurements. iMg appears more sensitive in detecting arrhythmia risk, while tMg correlates with length of stay. These findings support the need for larger studies and suggest considering iMg in magnesium monitoring and replacement strategies.']",public,['15(8):498'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0002-4287-4390', 'prefLabel': 'AlNoumani, Jawahar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwtTWFxYmFsaSwgSnVoYWluYSBTYWxpbSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Al-Maqbali, Juhaina Salim '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0001-1871-4605', 'prefLabel': ' Al Maktoumi, Dr.Mohammed Salim '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7019-3827', 'prefLabel': 'Al Mamari, Qasim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwtSGFzaGltLCBBYmR1bCBIYWtlZW0g', 'prefLabel': 'Al-Hashim, Abdul Hakeem '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWwtQnVzYWlkaSwgTXVqYWhpZCA=', 'prefLabel': 'Al-Busaidi, Mujahid '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5622-6987', 'prefLabel': 'Falhammar, Henrik'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2077-7186', 'prefLabel': 'Al Alawi, Abdullah'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/ger', 'prefLabel': 'Deutsch'}]",['Dysmagnesemia in the ICU: A Comparative Analysis of Ionized and Total Magnesium Levels and Their Clinical Associations'],2025-07-24T08:55:50.929+0200,355.0

This study aims to identify prognostic factors of lung cancer in the upper lobe, as well as to establish an effective nomogram for individualized overall survival (OS) prediction. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database for the period of 2010–2017,as recorder in the 2021 SEER database release. The demographic characteristics and OS differed in the primary sites of the upper, middle and lower lobes were drawn. The primary upper lobe lung cancer patients were further stratified by the risk indicators including Mets at DX-bone, stage, histology, grade and sex; and their OS differences in stratification were compared by the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-Rank test. The univariate and the multivariate Cox regression were employed to determine the independent prognostic factors for the primary upper lobe lung cancer and to build a nomogram model for its OS prediction. RESULTS: Depending on the different primary sites of lung cancer occurrence, all the collected patients were divided into three groups of the upper lobe (30295 individuals), the middle lobe (2801 individuals) and the lower lobe (16757 individuals), where the upper lobe group gained our attention with the largest population and an overwhelmingly low OS compared to the middle lobe group (P <0.0001). With the results of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analyses, age, sex, grade, histology type, stage, regional lymph nodes removed, bone metastasis and liver metastasis were selected as the prognostic factors and a prediction nomogram model was built. The calibration curves showed no significant bias from the reference line and the concordance index between the survival nomogram prediction and the actual outcome for 2-year and 3-year OS was 0.761 (95% CI, 0.757–0.765). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the areas under curve for 2-year and 3-year OS were 0.840 and 0.836, respectively. CONCLUSION: A novel nomogram was established which achieved good performance in predicting the probability of OS in the primary upper lobe lung cancer, indicating its potential value in individualized prediction of the clinical outcome in these patients.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0321955'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-2298-0240', 'prefLabel': 'yu, wenze'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG9uZywgTHU=', 'prefLabel': 'Long, Lu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG91LCBRaXpodW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Hou, Qizhuo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1920-9096', 'prefLabel': 'Yi, Bin'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Development of a nomogram for overall survival prediction in primary upper lobe lung cancer patients: A SEER population-based analysis'],2025-05-09T10:00:46.541+0200,337.0

The relationship between impulsive suicidal behavior (ISB) and impulsivity as a trait, which can be assessed by specific questionnaires, is still unclear. This study, therefore aimed to investigate this association by comparing the degree of trait impulsivity as well as clinical and demographic variables in individuals with ISB to those with non-impulsive suicidal behavior (NISB). METHODS: We included 130 adult inpatients admitted to a psychiatric ward of three psychiatric hospitals in Thuringia, Germany after a suicide attempt. Three distinct criteria were applied to define ISB, considering time- and planning-related aspects, as well as prior suicidal attempts using the Suicide Intent Scale and a structured clinical interview. Trait impulsivity was assessed using the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation- Seeking (UPPS) Impulsive Behavior Scale. RESULTS: No significant differences in the four UPPS impulsivity components controlling for multiple clinical and suicide specific variables were observed between the ISB and NISB groups across all three criteria as well as in clinical and demographic variables. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the complexity of the relationship between ISB and the various facets of impulsivity. They further highlight the need to improve standardized assessment methods to better identify individuals at risk for ISB and to develop effective intervention strategies to prevent such individuals from engaging in suicidal behavior during acute crises.']",public,['188:200-208'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFobG1hbm4sIEx5ZGlh', 'prefLabel': 'Bahlmann, Lydia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO8YmJlcnQsIE1hcmxlaG4=', 'prefLabel': 'Lübbert, Marlehn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVyZWtpZHplLCBBbmk=', 'prefLabel': 'Zerekidze, Ani'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NodWx6LCBBbGV4YW5kcmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Schulz, Alexandra'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2504-6107', 'prefLabel': 'Kastner, Ulrich Werner'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0647-8924', 'prefLabel': 'Sobanski, Thomas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7857-4483', 'prefLabel': 'Walter, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2296-0259', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Gerd'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Does trait impulsivity differentiate impulsive from non-impulsive suicide attempts?'],2025-06-16T13:00:07.657+0200,242.0

frl:6511604,"[""Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent and deadly disease, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Traditional chemotherapy often encounters drug resistance and adverse side effects, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Artemisia herba-alba, a plant rich in phytochemical constituents, was investigated for its potential as an anticancer agent against colorectal cancer (CRC). The primary objective of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of the methanolic extract of A. herba-alba on eight CRC cell lines including: Caco-2, DLD1, RKO+/+p53, RKO−/−p53, HCT+/+p53, HCT−/−p53, SW620, and SW480. Specifically, the study investigated the extract's impact on cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Chemical derivatization and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis revealed a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including ephedrine, hydroxyflavone, quinolinic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, borneol, β-eudesmol, and camphor, known for their cytotoxic properties. The methanolic extract of A. herba-alba exhibited varying degrees of cytotoxicity across a panel of CRC cell lines, with IC50 values indicating differential sensitivity. The extract triggered apoptosis in many cell lines, irrespective of p53 status. Importantly, A. herba-alba extract caused G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in CRC cells, accompanied by a decrease in Cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression. Furthermore, the extract demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, crucial in cancer progression. These findings highlight the promising anticancer potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a valuable resource for innovative CRC treatments.

The objective of this systematic review was to assess epidemiologic evidence on etiologic factors for prostate cancer by tumor TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status in human populations. Of 3071 publications identified, 19 cohort or case–control studies from six distinct study populations were included in this systematic review. Etiologic factors included germline genetic variants, circulating hormones, and dietary and lifestyle factors. Taller height, higher total and free testosterone levels, and fewer trinucleotide repeats in AR were possibly associated with higher risk of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer. Excess body weight, greater vigorous physical activity, higher lycopene intake, and the use of calcium channel blockers were associated with lower risk of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer. Diabetes and family history of prostate cancer were associated with both TMPRSS2:ERG-positive and TMPRSS2:ERG-negative prostate cancer. Prostate cancer germline variants had suggestive differential associations with TMPRSS2:ERG-positive or TMPRSS2:ERG-negative prostate cancer. However, results were based on few distinct study populations and generally had low precision, underscoring the need for replication. In conclusion, prostate cancer with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion is an etiologically distinct subtype that may be, in part, preventable by addressing modifiable and hormonally acting etiologic factors that align with the established mechanistic role of TMPRSS2:ERG in androgen, insulin, antioxidant, and growth factor pathways.']",public,['156(10):1898-1908'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4542-2955', 'prefLabel': 'McGrath, Colleen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-4391', 'prefLabel': 'Shreves, Alaina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhbmFoYW4sIE1lZ2FuIFIu', 'prefLabel': 'Shanahan, Megan R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VhcmQsIEhhbm5haCBFLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Guard, Hannah E.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmhsaXppeW8sIE1hbmVsaXNpIFYu', 'prefLabel': 'Nhliziyo, Manelisi V.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVybmFyLCBDbGFpcmUgSC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Pernar, Claire H.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVubmV5LCBLYXRocnluIEwu', 'prefLabel': 'Penney, Kathryn L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TG90YW4sIFRhbWFyYSBMLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lotan, Tamara L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmlvcmVudGlubywgTWljaGVsYW5nZWxv', 'prefLabel': 'Fiorentino, Michelangelo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVjY2ksIExvcmVsZWkgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Mucci, Lorelei A.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0722-1311', 'prefLabel': 'Stopsack, Konrad H.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Etiology of prostate cancer with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion: A systematic review of risk factors'],2025-08-08T13:59:33.798+0200,266.0

Despite a number of treatments available, most NMIBC patients with high-grade tumors eventually recur. To add a novel therapy to complement the deficits of the current treatments, this study assesses the antitumor activity and mechanisms of action of intravesical xenogeneic urothelial cell (XUC) treatment as monotherapy and in combination with either chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI).\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe orthotopic NMIBC graft tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into different treatment groups, receiving either intravesical XUCs, gemcitabine, anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies alone or in combination with gemcitabine or anti-PD-1 antibodies. The tumor responses, survival, and immune reactions were analyzed.\r\nRESULTS: \r\nIntravesical XUC treatment exhibited significantly more antitumor activity to delay tumor progression than the control group and a similar effect to chemotherapy and ICI. In addition, there were significantly higher effects in the combined groups than single treatments.

This study examines the consumption patterns and behaviors of European consumers regarding meat substitutes and identifies factors influencing their acceptance as alternative protein sources. The study involved 5000 participants from four European countries—France, Germany, Italy, and Spain with data extracted from the Mintel consumer database in 2024. Results indicate that over 50% of consumers in these countries have reduced their intake of red meat, with a notable portion of German consumers adhering to a vegan diet. Across the sample, females significantly differ from males, as they consume less meat, tend to limit their meat intake, and show a greater interest in reducing meat consumption. Baby Boomers predominantly consume more meat and show less interest in reducing their meat intake compared to younger generations. Economic and sustainability aspects are key perceptions driving the perceived benefits of reducing meat consumption. Additionally, preferences for locally sourced products, meat-like taste and texture, and natural ingredients are primary considerations when purchasing meat substitutes. Fish substitutes were rated as popular meat substitutes in France, Italy, and Spain, while breaded or battered meat/poultry substitutes were the most popular choice in Germany. Insights from this study are valuable for market researchers and the food industry, offering guidance on supplying appealing and sustainable protein alternatives that encourage a shift toward healthier and more sustainable consumption behavior.']",public,['13(1):e4753'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1358-627X', 'prefLabel': 'Mustapa, Muhammad Adzran Che'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFiYSwgWWFzbWluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Baba, Yasmina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFpc2hha2h5LCBTbWl0YSBEYXNo', 'prefLabel': 'Baishakhy, Smita Dash'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2870-3691', 'prefLabel': 'Kallas, Zein'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Evolving Appetites: Current Evidence and Future Perspectives in Terms of Meat Substitutes in Europe'],2025-09-02T12:31:29.856+0200,286.0

This study aimed to construct a prognostic model based on HBx-related genes and explore their relationship with immune infiltration and immunotherapy response. Through transcriptome sequencing of our HBx-expressing HepG2 cells and analysis of HCC patient data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and genotype-tissue expression (GTEx), we identified seven HBx-related genes, nuclear VCP-like (NVL), WD repeat domain 75 (WDR75), NOP58 nucleolar protein (NOP58), Brix domain-containing protein 1 (BRIX1), deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal interacting protein 2 (DNTTIP2), MKI67 FHA domain interacting nucleolar phosphoprotein (NIFK), and ribosome production factor 2 (RPF2), associated with poor prognosis. LASSO Cox regression narrowed these to four key genes (BRIX1, RPF2, DNTTIP2, and WDR75), which were used to develop a prognostic riskscore signature. High-risk patients exhibited lower survival rates, decreased infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells, poorer responses to immunotherapy, and increased immune evasion. Among the four genes, DNTTIP2 showed higher expression in single-cell data, was linked to migration inhibitory factor (MIF) signaling, and may play a pivotal role in shaping an immunosuppressive TME. Elevated DNTTIP2 expression was confirmed in HBx-expressing HepG2 cells and HBV-infected HCC samples. This study highlights a novel HBx-related four-gene prognostic model that predicts clinical outcomes, immune infiltration, and immunotherapy response, offering insights into HCC progression and potential therapeutic targets.']",public,['20(6):e0325363'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvbmcsIEppYW5odWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhong, Jianhua'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFl1ZXRvbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yuetong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBZYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Yang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWlhbywgSmll', 'prefLabel': 'Qiao, Jie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFlpbGluZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Yiling'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29uZywgWGlueWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Kong, Xinyi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWksIE1pYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Qi, Miao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGluLCBZaXFp', 'prefLabel': 'Lin, Yiqi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFvLCBZYXFp', 'prefLabel': 'Yao, Yaqi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmluLCBZaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Jin, Ying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmksIENoYW5nbG9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Bi, Changlong'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-4488-978X', 'prefLabel': 'Zhai, Aixia'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)-mediated immune modulation and prognostic model development in hepatocellular carcinoma'],2025-07-15T10:03:22.676+0200,355.0
frl:6510909,"['BACKGROUND: The two-component system (TCS) serves as a common intracellular signal transduction pathway implicated in various processes of plant development and response to abiotic stress. With regard to the important cereal crop barley, only partial information about the occurrence of TCS signaling elements in the genome and putative functions is available. RESULTS: In this study, we identified a total of 67 non-redundant TCS genes from all subgroups of the phosphorelay in the latest barley reference genome. Functional annotation and phylogenetic characterization was combined with a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the signaling components. Expression profiles hint at potential functions in vegetative and reproductive organs and tissue types as well as diverse stress responses. Apparently, a distinct subset of TCS genes revealed a stringent grain-specificity not being expressed elsewhere in the plant. By using laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based transcript analysis of barley grain tissues, we refined expression profiles of selected TCS genes and attributed them to individual cell types within the grain. Distinct TCS elements are exclusively expressed in the different maternal and filial cell types, particularly in the endosperm transfer cell (ETC) region. These genes are deemed to be selected in the domestication process of modern cultivars. Moreover, barley plants transformed with a synthetic sensor (TCSn::GFP) showed a high and specific activity in the ETC region of grains monitoring transcriptional output of the signaling system. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide comprehensive insights into the TCS gene family in the temperate cereal crop barley and indicate implications in various agronomic traits. The dataset is valuable for future research in different aspects of plant development and will be indispensable not only for barley, but also for other crops of the Poaceae.']",public,['25(1):209'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2320-7579', 'prefLabel': 'Hertig, Christian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV2dW51cmksIFByYXZpbnlh', 'prefLabel': 'Devunuri, Pravinya'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5891-6503', 'prefLabel': 'Rutten, Twan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5539-3097', 'prefLabel': 'Hensel, Götz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7934-126X', 'prefLabel': 'Schippers, Jozefus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TcO8bGxlciwgQnJ1bm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Müller, Bruno'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3924-6940', 'prefLabel': 'Thiel, Johannes'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Genome-wide characterization of two-component system elements in barley enables the identification of grain-specific phosphorelay genes'],2025-04-07T15:06:07.048+0200,325.0

Some important genes regulating rice tillering have been identified, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor. Beyond its well-established role in promoting spikelet formation during the reproductive phase, here we demonstrate that FZP also inhibits axillary buds outgrowth in the vegetative phase by suppressing the expression of a MADS-box gene (OsMADS57) that functions as a growth promoter. Consequently, genome editing of the FZP-bound cis-motif in the promoter of OsMADS57 releases its expression, leading to more tillers. Furthermore, domestication analysis shows that FZP has undergone strong selection in cultivated rice, while the downstream gene OsMADS57 has been differentiated between indica and japonica subspecies. Four functional SNPs in the promoter of OsMADS57 can increase rice tillering in most indica accessions by enhancing its expression. Our findings expose hidden pleiotropy of classic spikelet identity genes that are redeployed to control stem form, potentially enriching the gene resources for rice genetic improvement.']",public,['23(4):1202-1212'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGluZywgSG9uZ3dlaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Xing, Hongwei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgSHVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Huan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7476-1350', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Yongyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIFhpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Xin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFNoZW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Sheng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFl1YW5qaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yuanjie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VuLCBDaHVhbnFpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Sun, Chuanqing'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4573-7650', 'prefLabel': 'Sun, Hongying'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['FZP modulates tillering via OsMADS57 in rice'],2025-04-10T15:44:47.590+0200,325.0

RESULTS: Sixty percent of 109,707 participants reported at least one previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; 35% reported having had any symptoms 4–12 months after infection; among them 23% reported nine or more symptoms. Individuals, who did not develop PCC after their first infection, had a strongly reduced risk for PCC after their second infection (50%) and a temporary risk reduction, which waned over 9 months after the preceding infection. The risk of developing PCC strongly depended on the virus variant. Within variants, there was no effect of the number of preceding vaccinations, apart from a strong protection by the fourth vaccination compared to three vaccinations for the Omicron variant (odds ratio = 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.61).

Recent studies have highlighted the beneficial impact of moderate beer intake on metabolic diseases. The purpose of this research is to explore the possible molecular mechanisms of isoxanthohumol (IXN), the major hop flavonoid in beer, in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The mice model of acute hyperlipidemia was constructed by intraperitoneal injection of Triton WR-1339. The therapeutic effect of IXN was assessed by biochemical and histological analyses. Furthermore, comprehensive data mining across various public databases was conducted to identify underlying therapeutic targets of IXN on hyperlipidemia. A protein–protein interaction network was constructed to pinpoint hub targets, and subsequent GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to elucidate underlying biological functions. Molecular docking was utilized to validate the binding affinity between hub targets and IXN. Western blotting analysis further verified the protein expression of potential IXN targets. IXN administration significantly improved blood lipid and hepatic lipid levels, alongside increased SOD activity and decreased MDA content in hyperlipidemia mice.

In this study, we investigated the interactions in shoot biomass of dual cover crop mixtures and their competitiveness to suppress weeds before winter under different growing conditions.\r\nMethods: A field experiment was performed on sandy loam soil in Triesdorf, Germany, for two consecutive years. The cover crop species white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis L.), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia J.), Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and field bean (Vicia faba L.) were grown in pure stands or dual mixtures. Cover crops were sown in August, and shoot biomass was harvested at the end of the vegetation period. Cover crop shoot biomass was dried, and the share of each species and the sown test weed (Brassica napus L.) were determined.\r\nResults: The share of shoot biomass of a cover crop species in dual-species mixtures was closely related to its shoot biomass in its pure stand. In both years, mustard and phacelia showed similar interactions in shoot biomass production when growing with a second species. Regarding competitiveness against weeds, cruciferous species outperformed other cover crop species and could suppress weeds even if they were mixed with a less competitive partner. Weed suppression of mixtures with phacelia depended on the second component in the mixture and was more effective in a dry season. Legume species, especially Egyptian clover and common vetch could not suppress weeds in a pure stand.\r\nDiscussion: Our results show that species with high weed suppression potential as single stands retain this ability in dual cover crop mixtures, regardless of the suppression potential of the second species that completes the mixture.']",public,['6:1416379'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9628-1609', 'prefLabel': 'Groß, Jonas'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9824-5692', 'prefLabel': 'Kümmerer, Robin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8664-0559', 'prefLabel': 'Heuermann, Diana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1166-8973', 'prefLabel': 'Gentsch, Norman'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2Nod2VuZWtlciwgRMO2cnRl', 'prefLabel': 'Schweneker, Dörte'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmV1ZXJzdGVpbiwgVWxm', 'prefLabel': 'Feuerstein, Ulf'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6962-8264', 'prefLabel': 'Guggenberger, Georg'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-425X', 'prefLabel': 'von Wirén, Nicolaus'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-9277-1512', 'prefLabel': 'Bauer, Bernhard'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Improving dual cover crop mixtures to increase shoot biomass production and weed suppression potential'],2025-04-14T13:43:14.652+0200,325.0

Some of these seaweeds have recognized health benefits but have not been fully investigated in terms of their bioactive components and mechanisms of action. We employed ultrasonication with 70% methanol to extract phenolic compounds from these seaweeds and investigated a range of bioactivities for these extracts, including anti-inflammatory activity exploring urease inhibition, nitric oxide scavenging activity, protein denaturation inhibition, and protease inhibition. Anti-diabetic activities were investigated using α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition assays. Anti-proliferative and anti-mitotic activities were evaluated using yeast-cell and green-gram models, respectively. Our findings showed that C.\u2009siliquosa inhibited nitric oxide, urease, and protease activities, with S.\u2009fallax, P.\u2009comosa, and E.\u2009radiata exhibiting substantial inhibition of protein denaturation. E.\u2009radiata displayed inhibitory effects on both α-amylase and α-glucosidase, whereas P.\u2009comosa targeted only the α-glucosidase enzyme, indicating different mechanisms of anti-diabetic activity. In these anti-mitotic assays, C.\u2009siliquosa exhibited low cell viability and a significant anti-proliferative effect, particularly within 24\u2009h, while E.\u2009radiata demonstrated notable inhibition at 48\u2009h. LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS investigation identified 48 phenolic compounds, including 19 phenolic acids, 20 flavonoids, and 9 other polyphenols.

Our serial in vitro fermentation investigations found that mannose in DOP was more utilized by gut microbiota under diabetic status with higher production of propanoic acid and lower production of butyric acid compared with those under healthy status. Moreover, metabolomic analyses revealed different impacts of DOP on intestinal microbial metabolites between healthy and diabetic status with upregulating taurine and downregulating 2-hydroxybutyric acid only occurring under diabetic status. Biodiversity analyses demonstrated that DOP treatment could only significantly improve the diversity of gut microbiota under diabetic status while there was no significant effect on that under healthy status. Further gut microbiota composition analyses indicated that DOP treatment could promote probiotics (Dubosiella, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia) under both healthy and diabetic status while inhibit pathogens (Escherichia-Shigella) only under diabetic status.

METHOD: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were measured using an online survey instrument, between May 2020 and April 2021, in four waves completed at 3-monthly intervals. Analyses were based on data from the COvid MEntal healTh (COMET) survey which investigated the mental health effects of the COVID-19 outbreak spanning 13 countries on five continents in N\u2009=\u20097,909 participants. RESULTS: From the first to the last wave, women reported a greater increase in home and work responsibilities, and had higher depression, anxiety and PTSD scores compared to men. Women who reported a reduction in income due to the pandemic had higher depression scores. Working harder and experiencing a reduction in income were also associated with higher anxiety scores in women but not in men. Women were more likely to score above the cut-off for depression (32.5% vs 23.6%, p\u2009<\u2009.001), anxiety (21.2% vs 14.4%, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and PTSD (21.2% vs 14.4%, p\u2009<\u2009.001) than men during the first wave. Stronger reliance on socially supported coping mechanisms was a risk factor for depression, anxiety and PTSD in men and women.

Participants were interviewed to collect their perceptions of the risk of catching COVID-19 (baseline and follow-up) and the number and type of PEC. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests were used to assess differences in baseline characteristics, and prevalence ratios were estimated using crude and adjusted modified Poisson generalized linear models. RESULTS: Of the overall study population, 7,069 participants were eligible for the analysis. The majority (83.7%) of the eligible study population had a history of any PEC. Those with a history of any PEC had a median age of 58 (range: 19–97), were primarily female (67.6%), White non-Hispanic (87.8%), had some college (30.3%), were married or living as married (74.4%), lived in an urban region (67.6%), and reported good (35.4%) or very good (33.9%) health. At baseline, study participants with a history of any PEC were more likely to be concerned about catching COVID-19, using a scale of 0–100, compared to those without PECs (Mean[SD] 60.8[29.8] vs. 53.2[29.7]; p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as more likely concerned about someone they knew catching COVID-19 (Mean[SD] 70.0[28.8] vs. 64.4[29.4]; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The main effects models showed that self-concern of getting COVID-19 was higher in individuals with any PEC, compared to those with no history of PEC (Prevalence Ratio [PR], 1.15; 95%CI, 1.03–1.29); self-concern was lower at follow-up for those with any PEC, compared to baseline (PR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.65–0.71). There was evidence of an interaction in the models of concern for self and others, suggesting that one’s perception of risk was influenced by both the presence/absence of PECs and study time points. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with PECs perceived a higher risk of COVID-19 infection for themselves and others towards the beginning of the pandemic, although this perception of susceptibility, or risk, was lower at follow-up.

Efforts to optimize surface expression in T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapeutic approaches include optimization of cellular engineering methods and coding sequences, and reducing the likelihood of exogenous TCR α and β chains mispairing with the endogenous TCR chains. Approaches to promote correct human TCR chain pairing include constant region mutations to create an additional disulfide bond between the two chains, full murinization of the constant region of the TCR α and β sequences, and a minimal set of murine mutations to the TCR α and β constant regions. Preclinical animal models are valuable tools to optimize engineering designs and methods, and to evaluate the potential for off-target tissue injury. To further develop rhesus macaque models for TCR based cellular immunotherapy, we tested methods for improving cell surface expression of rhesus macaque TCR in rhesus macaque primary cells by generating five alternative TCRαβ constant region constructs in the context of a SIV Gag-specific TCR: 1. human codon optimized rhesus macaque (RH); 2. RH TCR with an additional disulfide linkage; 3. rhesus macaque constant sequences with minimal murine amino acid substitutions; 4. murinized constant sequences; and 5. murinized constant sequences with a portion of the exposed FG loop in the β constant sequence replaced with rhesus macaque sequence to reduce potential immunogencity. Murinization or mutation of a minimal set of amino acids to the corresponding murine sequence of the constant region resulted in the greatest increase in rhesus macaque TCR surface expression relative to wild type.

While there is a large body of literature on the impact of school food policies on health and non-health outcomes, it is essential to identify which policies are effective and can be recommended for implementation to ensure the efficient use of resources. This article presents a protocol for a scoping review that aims to map the current published literature on the effects of school food policies on health outcomes, acceptance and affordability in secondary school children in Europe. Moreover, the scoping review will map the measurements used to assess health outcomes, acceptance and affordability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review protocol and review follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review. To identify eligible studies, we will search MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science. The reference lists of the included articles will be checked for additional studies. In addition, country-specific ministry reports from Member States of the European Union, the UK, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland will be identified. The WHO and European Commission websites will also be searched for relevant reports. The scoping review will include literature published until 20 September 2023. No restrictions to study design and language will be applied. Screening and data extraction will be carried out independently by three reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion. A pretested data charting table will be used to extract key information. Findings will be presented in tabular and visualised summaries and a narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This scoping review does not require ethical approval. Our dissemination strategy comprises peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and recommendations to policy-makers.']",public,['14:e080153'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-5154-0562', 'prefLabel': 'Meuer, Janina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmxlY2hhLCBOYWRpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Blecha, Nadia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SMO8Ym5lciwgV2llYmtl', 'prefLabel': 'Hübner, Wiebke'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-255X', 'prefLabel': 'Christianson, Lara'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-2141', 'prefLabel': 'Wolters, Maike'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6043-9072', 'prefLabel': 'Busse, Heide'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-5958', 'prefLabel': 'Hebestreit, Antje'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7169-675X', 'prefLabel': 'Forberger, Sarah'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Mapping the existing evidence of the effects of school food policies on health, acceptance and affordability of secondary school children in Europe: A scoping review protocol']",2025-02-12T10:28:51.662+0100,266.0
frl:6510978,"[""Different cross-selection (CS) methods incorporating genomic selection (GS) have been used in diploid species to improve long-term genetic gain and preserve diversity. However, their application to heterozygous and autotetraploid crops such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is lacking so far. The objectives of our study were to (i) assess the effects of different CS methods and the incorporation of GS and genetic variability monitoring on both short- and long-term genetic gains compared to strategies using phenotypic selection (PS); (ii) evaluate the changes in genetic variability and the efficiency of converting diversity into genetic gain across different CS methods; and (iii) investigate the interaction effects between different genetic architectures and CS methods on long-term genetic gain. In our simulation results, implementing GS with optimal selected proportions had increased short- and long-term genetic gain compared to any PS strategy. The CS method considering additive and dominance effects to predict progeny mean based on simulated progenies (MEGV-O) achieved the highest long-term genetic gain among the assessed mean-based CS methods. Compared to MEGV-O and usefulness criteria (UC), the linear combination of UC and genome-wide diversity (called EUCD) maintained the same level of genetic gain but resulted in higher diversity and a lower number of fixed QTLs. Moreover, EUCD had a relatively high degree of efficiency in converting diversity into genetic gain. However, choosing the most appropriate weight to account for diversity in EUCD depends on the genetic architecture of the target trait and the breeder's objectives. Our results provide breeders with concrete methods to improve their potato breeding programs.""]",public,['18(1):e70000'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7342-2867', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Po-Ya'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6791-8068', 'prefLabel': 'Stich, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFydGplLCBTdGVmYW5pZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hartje, Stefanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVkZXJzLCBLYXRqYSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Muders, Katja '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJpZ2dlLCBWYW5lc3Nh', 'prefLabel': 'Prigge, Vanessa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2819-843X', 'prefLabel': 'Van Inghelandt, Delphine'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Optimal implementation of genomic selection in clone breeding programs exemplified in potato: II.

However, its high degree of unsaturation makes it susceptible to rapid degradation when exposed to oxygen and light. This study investigates the encapsulation of PSO at 15% w/w using different blends of gum Arabic (GA) and maltodextrin (MD) (1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, and 1:3) to determine optimal formulations for enhanced stability and functional quality. Characterization of the encapsulated PSO powders showed distinct particle morphologies, including flake-like shapes and textures ranging from smooth to wrinkled and porous. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra indicated shifts in functional groups from 2973.70 to 408.84\u2009cm−1, revealing the presence of aliphatic, amine, aromatic, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups. Although no single formulation achieved all desired outcomes, the GA:MD ratios of 1:0 and 1:1 were superior in enhancing color properties (yellowness and chroma), techno-functional attributes (bulk density and solubility), and in preserving essential fatty acids, including stearic, cis-oleic, α-linolenic, arachidic, γ-linolenic, linoleic, and punicic acids. Additionally, GA:MD (3:1) powders exhibited superior ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities (RSA). In conclusion, formulations using solely GA or GA:MD ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 effectively preserve bioactive content in PSO, enhancing its antioxidant capacity. These findings suggest promising applications for these encapsulated powders in developing functional foods that meet industry demands.']",public,['12(11):9252-9267'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFuZ29wZSwgS3V0bG9hbm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Mangope, Kutloano'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3190-4769', 'prefLabel': 'Kaseke, Tafadzwa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5591-4633', 'prefLabel': 'Fawole, Olaniyi'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Microencapsulation and characterization of pomegranate seed oil using gum Arabic and maltodextrin blends for functional food applications'],2025-04-17T12:07:15.287+0200,286.0
frl:6525167,"['Banana fruits are harvested and then undergo rapid ripening and senescence, sharply limiting their shelf-life and marketability. Myo-inositol (MI) is an important regulator in ethylene production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation; however, its involvement in the postharvest ripening process of banana remains to be determined. This study found that postharvest application of MI could efficiently delay the fruit ripening and extend the time in which the luster, color, and hardness were maintained in two cultivars with contrasting storage characteristics, storable ‘Brazil’ and unstorable ‘Fenza No. 1’, when stored at room temperature (23 °C ± 2 °C). Moreover, physiological, metabolic, and gene expression analyses indicated that MI application improved MI metabolism and postponed ethylene biosynthesis and cell wall loosening. The decrease in ethylene production was associated with a reduction in the expression of ACS1 and ACO1 genes. MI treatment decreased the expressions of PL1/2, PG, and EXP1/7/8, which may account for the delay in softening. In addition, the application of MI could alleviate ROS-mediated senescence and cell membrane damage by promoting the activities of SOD, POD, and anti-O2− and decreasing PPO activity. This study shed light on the function of MI in regulating the postharvest ripening and senescence of bananas and provided an efficient strategy for extending shelf-life and reduce losses.']",public,['14(15):2638'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHUsIExpbmd5dQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hu, Lingyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFlp', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Yi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3009-635X', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Kun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hpLCBLYWlsaSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Shi, Kaili '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tml1LCBZaSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Niu, Yi '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UXUsIEZlbmcg', 'prefLabel': 'Qu, Feng '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFNoZW5nbGluIA==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Shenglin '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-4612-3761', 'prefLabel': 'he, weidi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFl1YW5saQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Yuanli'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Postharvest Application of Myo-Inositol Extends the Shelf-Life of Banana Fruit by Delaying Ethylene Biosynthesis and Improving Antioxidant Activity'],2025-07-28T11:53:31.002+0200,355.0

METHODS: First, based on large-scale data from the UK Biobank, we analyzed the associations between multiple sleep factors and RA risk and calculated a poor sleep score (PSS) to assess their combined effect. Then we constructed genetic risk scores (GRS) based on a large genome-wide association study and assessed the interaction or combined effect of sleep and genetic factors on RA risk. Finally, we conducted a case-control study to explore the effect of RA on sleep. RESULTS: Sleep duration, getting up, napping during the day, insomnia, and daytime dozing were associated with the risk of RA, but no associations were observed for chronotype and snoring with RA. Participants in the high genetic risk and high PSS group had a 363.1% higher risk of developing RA compared to those with low genetic risk and low PSS. We also found that women were more likely than men to be affected by the combined effects of PSS and GRS. In the case-control study, there were statistically significant associations of RA with getting up, PSS grade and PSS.

frl:6511445,"['INTRODUCTION: While incident ischemic lesions (IILs) are not unusual on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following stroke, their risk factors and prognostic significance remain unknown. METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study of 503 acute stroke patients, we assessed IILs on registered MRI images at baseline and 6 months, analyzing risk factors and clinical outcomes across 36 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, 78 patients (15.5%) had IILs, mostly diffusion-weighted imaging-positive (72%) and clinically covert (91%). Older age and small vessel disease (SVD) lesions were baseline risk factors for IILs. IILs were associated with worse cognitive (beta for global cognition: -0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.48 to -0.14) and functional outcomes (beta for modified Rankin scale [mRS]: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.58), and higher recurrent stroke risk (hazard ratio: 3.81, 95% CI: 1.35 to 10.69). IILs partially explained the relationship between SVD and poor cognition. DISCUSSION: IILs are common and are associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes and stroke recurrence risk. Assessing IILs following stroke might aid prognostication. HIGHLIGHTS: Incident ischemic lesions (IILs) were assessed with registered baseline and 6-month magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in a stroke cohort. IILs 6 months after stroke are present in one-sixth of patients and are mostly clinically silent. Small vessel disease burden is the main baseline risk factor for IILs. IILs are associated with cognitive and functional impairment and stroke recurrence. Assessing IILs by follow-up MRI aids long-term prognostication for stroke patients.']",public,['20(12):8412-8428'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5663-9407', 'prefLabel': 'Fang, Rong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RHVlcmluZywgTWFyY28=', 'prefLabel': 'Duering, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9kZSwgRmVsaXggSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bode, Felix J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3TDtnNzZXIsIFNlYmFzdGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Stösser, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVpw59uZXIsIEp1bGl1cyBOLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Meißner, Julius N.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVybWFubiwgUGV0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Hermann, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGltYW4sIFRob21hcyBHLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Liman, Thomas G.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5577-1775', 'prefLabel': 'Nolte, Christian H'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2VydGksIEx1Y2lh', 'prefLabel': 'Kerti, Lucia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWtlbmJlcmcsIEJlbm5v', 'prefLabel': 'Ikenberg, Benno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVybmtvcGYsIEthdGhsZWVu', 'prefLabel': 'Bernkopf, Kathleen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhbnosIFdlbnplbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Glanz, Wenzel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFub3dpdHosIERhbmllbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Janowitz, Daniel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FnbmVyLCBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmV1bWFubiwgS2F0amE=', 'prefLabel': 'Neumann, Katja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6019-5597', 'prefLabel': 'Speck, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0139-5388', 'prefLabel': 'Duzel, Emrah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VzaWVyaWNoLCBCZW5ubw==', 'prefLabel': 'Gesierich, Benno'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV3ZW50ZXIsIEFubmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Dewenter, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BvdHRrZSwgQW5uaWth', 'prefLabel': 'Spottke, Annika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FlZ2VtYW5uLCBLYXJpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Waegemann, Karin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R8O2cnRsZXIsIE1pY2hhZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Görtler, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3VuZGVybGljaCwgU2lsa2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Wunderlich, Silke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVyciwgSW5nYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zerr, Inga'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0em9sZCwgR2Fib3IgQy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Petzold, Gabor C.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-3720', 'prefLabel': 'Endres, Matthias '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2Vvcmdha2lzLCBNYXJpb3MgSy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Georgakis, Marios K.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0654-387X', 'prefLabel': 'Dichgans, Martin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Risk factors and clinical significance of post-stroke incident ischemic lesions'],2025-05-21T09:38:33.192+0200,242.0

These lines were screened for nematode infestation in a controlled environment for two years. QTL-mapping analyses were performed across two years (Y1 and Y2) as well as combining two years (CY) data. On the 114 lines that were screened, a total of 2,736 data points (genotype, batch or years, and replication combinations) were acquired. For QTL analysis, 12,093 markers (11,678 SNPs and 415 SSRs markers) were used, after filtering the genotypic data, for the QTL mapping. Composite interval mapping, using Haley-Knott regression (hk) method in R/QTL, was used for QTL analysis. In total, 19 QTLs were detected out of which 13 were novel and six were found to be colocalized or nearby to previously reported Cre genes, QTLs or MTAs for H. avenae or H. filipjevi. Nine QTLs were detected across all three groups (Y1, Y2 and CY) including a significant QTL ""QCcn.ha-2D"" on chromosome 2D that explains 23% of the variance. This QTL colocalized with a previously identified Cre3 locus. Novel QTL, QCcn.ha-2A, detected in the present study could be the possible unreported homeoloci to QCcn.ha-2D, QCcn.ha-2B.1 and QCcn.ha-2B.2. Six significant digenic epistatic interactions were also observed. In addition, 26 candidate genes were also identified including genes known for their involvement in PPNs (plant parasitic nematodes) resistance in different plant species.

These findings prompted us to investigate additional features of immune-oncology (I-O) agents or adjuvants, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition and their association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk, to explore the potential of SHH as an I-O agent or adjuvant. In this study, we investigated the effects of SHH on PD-L1 levels in various cancer cell types and assessed its effectiveness in treating RA, a common side effect of I-O agents. Our results showed a marked reduction in PD-L1 levels in multiple cancer cell lines and decreased PD-1 and PD-L1 levels in tumor-associated macrophages. In a mouse model with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), SHH exhibited anti-inflammatory effects comparable to methotrexate (MTX), a first-line treatment for RA. Both the SHH and MTX groups had significantly lower arthritis scores and paw thickness compared to the CIA group. Additionally, SHH or MTX treatment effectively reduced elevated levels of anticollagen type II (CII) antibodies and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). Histopathological analysis revealed that SHH and MTX treatments notably mitigated arthritic inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, and loss of articular cartilage and bone. Micro-CT scans showed reduced articular destruction in the SHH and MTX groups. These findings indicate that SHH treatment decreases PD-L1 levels in cancer cells and reduces the severity of CIA by exerting anti-inflammatory effects.

Studying electric potentials recorded invasively and noninvasively from the human spinal cord at millisecond resolution, we find that the cord generates electric potentials at 600 hertz that are modulated by prior knowledge about the time of sensory input, as early as 13 to 16 milliseconds after stimulation. Our results reveal that already in the spinal cord, sensory processing is under top-down, cognitive control, and that 600-hertz signals, which have been identified as a macroscopic marker of population spiking in other regions of the nervous system, play a role in early, context-dependent sensory processing.

More than 96% of the material is stored as desiccation-tolerant orthodox seeds according to the active–base–safety (A-B-S) replicate approach at -18°C. Almost 70,000 freshly regenerated safety replicates are stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. However, 4% of the material (2,000 field, 3,000 in vitro and 2,500 cryopreserved accessions) can only be maintained vegetatively, as no or few seeds or no true-breeding seeds are available. Most of the accessions are provided via the standard material transfer agreement (SMTA) and more than 1.2 million samples have been distributed since the genebank was founded. To guarantee the identity of the living plant material, reference samples comprising about 450,000 voucher specimens, 110,000 seed and fruit samples and 57,000 cereal spikes are used for comparisons. Genebank workflows are supported by the Genebank Information System (GBIS), which also manages workflow-independent data to describe the genebank accessions by passport, phenotypic and taxonomic data, thus allowing users to make targeted selections of material. The genebank-related processes, including acquisition, preservation, regeneration, documentation and material distribution, are certified for quality management in accordance with ISO 9001.

In addition, participation is often late and not particularly intensive, so that certain older groups of people are underrepresented in the development of health technologies (HT). Heterogeneity, e.g., between urban and rural populations, in access to and motivation for participation is also rarely taken into account. The aim of this study was to investigate form and phases of participation for hard-to-reach older people in the research and development process of HT. METHODS: The qualitative study among multipliers was conducted using focus groups and telephone interviews and took place in a city and an adjacent rural area in northwestern Lower Saxony, Germany. A content analysis of the data was undertaken using deductive-inductive category formation. RESULTS: Seventeen participants (13 female) took part in the study (median age 61, 33–73). Participants from both areas identified particular forms and phases of participation in the research and development process. Longer forms of participation for hard-to-reach groups and the development process of technologies for older people from the rural area were viewed as challenges. Passive and active access strategies are needed to achieve sufficient heterogeneity in the research and development process. Trusted multipliers can play an important role in gaining access to hard-to-reach older people, but also during the research process. Apart from facilitating factors (e.g., age-specific study materials), inhibiting factors such as contact anxieties are also indicated. Only urban participants mention financial/material incentives and community as possible motivations. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide important insights from the perspective of multipliers. They show specificities in access and participation for rural areas and for hard-to-reach older people. Many older people may have uncertainties about research projects and HT. Multipliers can assume a key role to help reduce these uncertainties in the future.']",public,['12:1334180'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGF1bHMsIEFsZXhhbmRlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pauls, Alexander'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S29wcGVsaW4sIEZyYXVrZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Koppelin, Frauke'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-242X', 'prefLabel': 'Zeeb, Hajo'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The participation of hard-to-reach older people in the research and development process of health technologies from the perspective of multipliers - A qualitative analysis'],2025-02-05T12:05:10.462+0100,266.0

For the normoglycemic assay, rats were divided into five groups and received a single oral dose of 100, 250, and 500\u2009mg/kg of BMEE while the control groups received distilled water and Glibenclamide. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were determined on a weekly basis for 28\u2009days in diabetic rats after treatment with BMEE at 250 and 500\u2009mg/kg dosage levels. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), serum insulin levels, lipid profile and messenger RNA expression levels of Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and Nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFKβ) genes were determined. BMEE did not induce hypoglycemic effects in rats with normal blood glucose levels, but induced antidiabetic activities in the experimental type-2 diabetic rats. BMEE lowered FBG levels, increased oral glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitization, and reduced insulin resistance. Treatment of diabetic rats with BMEE increased lipid metabolism and relatively higher expression levels of IRS-1 and GLUT2 genes, and led to reduced expression levels of NFKβ in the liver. Overall, this study reports that BMEE has potential as a nutraceutical to be utilized in the management of T2DM.']",public,['13(1):e4635'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4380-7811', 'prefLabel': 'Nakakaawa, Lilian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2JhbGEsIElmZW9sdXdhIEQu', 'prefLabel': 'Gbala, Ifeoluwa D.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFyZ3VsLCBKb2VsIEwu', 'prefLabel': 'Bargul, Joel L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlc2V0bywgWGF2aWVy', 'prefLabel': 'Cheseto, Xavier'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2Vzb25nYSwgSm9obiBNLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wesonga, John M.'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Therapeutic Potential of Brassica carinata Microgreens Extract in Alleviating Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes in Wistar Rats'],2025-07-10T12:03:45.958+0200,286.0

Zunächst wurden für 172 Patienten umfassende klinische und operative Parameter sowie prätherapeutische CT-Daten erhoben. Zur Erstellung von Radiomics erfolgten manuelle Segmentierungen der Nieren und Nierentumoren. Im Anschluss wurden prädiktive Algorithmen entwickelt: Mit maschinellen Lernverfahren wurden klinische Daten und CT-basierte Radiomic Features analysiert. Ein logistisches Regressionsmodell mit 48 Variablen erreichte zur AKIVorhersage eine AUC von 0,649 (95\u202f% CI: 0,55–0,749) bei einer Sensitivität von 53,3\u202f% und Spezifität von DFG-Abschlussbericht UH 327/3-1 – 511948726 2 72,5\u202f%, während für CKD bessere Werte erzielt wurden (AUC 0,796, 95\u202f% CI: 0,686–0,907, Sensitivität 87,1\u202f%, Spezifität 73,6\u202f%). Zusätzlich wurde ein Deep-Learning-Ansatz mittels eines vortrainierten Convolutional Neural Network (mobilenet v3 small) evaluiert, der für CKD hinter den Erwartungen zurückblieb, während für AKI qualitativ bessere Vorhersagen erzielt wurden. Aufgrund kapazitiver Engpässe seitens der Projektpartner wurde eine Kooperation mit dem Deutschen Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) etabliert. Bei 98 Patienten wurden random forest Modelle auf Basis von 42 klinischen Variablen und Radiomic Features erstellt. Dabei unterschieden die Modelle zwischen ausschließlicher Nutzung von Radiomics (Trainings-AUC 0,759, Test-AUC 0,646), nur klinischen Parametern (Trainings-AUC 0,857, Test-AUC 0,769) und einer Kombination beider Datenquellen, wobei letztere die leistungsstärkste Methode darstellte (Trainings-AUC 0,891, Test-AUC 0,707). Zudem ermöglichten DeepLearning-Analysen Einblicke in die Relevanz einzelner Parameter für die CKD-Prädiktion. Aktuell sind zwei Publikationen in Vorbereitung und ein Konferenzabstract eingereicht. Zusammengefasst zeigt das Projekt, dass die Kombination aus klinischen Daten und Radiomics mittels maschineller Lernverfahren einen vielversprechenden Ansatz zur Prädiktion von AKI und CKD darstellt.

Neben zahlreichen molekularen Methoden kamen auch bioinformatische Ansätze zum Einsatz, die zu einem besseren biologischen Verständnis der T-Zellentwicklung im humanen wie auch im murinen System geführt haben. Zusätzlich zu den primär definierten Zielen entstand durch die Kooperation mehrere Gruppen eine neue Technologie, die es gestattet Vorgänge in Histologischen Schnitten des Immunsystems in 3D und 4D also in Raum und Zeit zu analysieren. Insbesondere auch diese Ergebnisse waren Ausgangspunkt für ein DFG-Folgeprojekt mit dem Inhalt der Erforschung von T-Zell- und NKZelltherapien („Etablierung eines 4D ex vivo Netzwerk-Modells humaner Lymphome zur Evaluation der Wirksamkeit von CAR T- und NK-Zell-Therapien“ (4D-CARLY)).

Using the 56-plex co-detection by indexing (CODEX) antibody panel, they compared the tumor architecture and microenvironment between non-malignant reactive lymph nodes (rLNs), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL-LNs), and FL-LNs. They identified 21 distinct hematopoietic cell types as well as non-hematopoietic structure-defining cell types or cell states. Their study revealed that cellular neighborhoods were conserved mainly between nonmalignant and FL-LNs but were altered due to the malignant expansion of FL cells.

Although reactive epitopes in the PLA2R domains have been identified, the clinical value of these domains recognized by anti-PLA2R antibodies remains controversial. Accordingly, this study aimed to quantitatively detect changes in the concentrations of different antibodies against epitopes of PLA2R in patients with IMN before and after treatment to evaluate the clinical value of epitope spreading. METHODS: Highly sensitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay was used to quantitatively analyze the concentrations of specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies against PLA2R and its epitopes (CysR, CTLD1, CTLD6-7-8) in a cohort of 25 patients with PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy (13 and 12 in the remission and non-remission groups, respectively) before and after treatment, and the results were analyzed in conjunction with clinical biochemical indicators. RESULTS: The concentration of specific IgG (IgG4) antibodies against PLA2R and its epitopes (CysR, CTLD1 and CTLD6-7-8) in non-remission group was higher than that in remission group. The multipliers of elevation of IgG (IgG4) antibody were 5.6(6.2) fold, 3.0(24.3) fold, 1.6(9.0) fold, and 4.2(2.6) fold in the non-remission/remission group, respectively. However, the difference in antibody concentrations between the two groups at the end of follow-up was 5.6 (85.2), 1.7 (13.1), 1.0 (5.1), and 1.5 (22.3) times higher, respectively. When detecting concentrations of specific IgG antibodies against PLA2R and its different epitopes, the remission rate was 66.67% for only one epitope at M0 and 36.36% for three epitopes at M0. When detecting concentrations of specific IgG4 antibodies against PLA2R and its different epitopes, the remission rate was 100.00% for only one epitope at M0 and 50.00% for three epitopes at M0. A trivariate logistic regression model for the combined detection of eGFR, anti-CTLD678 IgG4, and urinary protein had an AUC of 100.00%. CONCLUSION: Low concentrations of anti-CysR-IgG4, anti-CTLD1-IgG4, and anti-CTLD6-7-8-IgG4 at initial diagnosis predict rapid remission after treatment.

Anti-PLA2R antibody levels are closely associated with disease severity and therapeutic effectiveness. Analysis of PLA2R antigen epitope reactivity may have a greater predictive value for remission compared with total PLA2R-antibody level. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between domain-specific antibody levels and clinical outcomes of PMN. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 87 patients with PLA2R-associated PMN. Among them, 40 and 47 were treated with rituximab (RTX) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) regimen, respectively. The quantitative detection of -immunoglobulin G (IgG)/-IgG4 targeting PLA2R and its epitope levels in the serum of patients with PMN were obtained through time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays and served as biomarkers in evaluating the treatment effectiveness. A predictive PMN remission possibility nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Discrimination in the prediction model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).Bootstrap ROC was used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. RESULTS: After a 6-month treatment period, the remission rates of proteinuria, including complete remission and partial remission in the RTX and CTX groups, were 70% and 70.21% (P = 0.983), respectively. However, there was a significant difference in immunological remission in the PLA2R-IgG4 between the RTX and CTX groups (21.43% vs. 61.90%, P = 0.019). Furthermore, we found differences in PLA2R-CysR-IgG4(P = 0.030), PLA2R-CTLD1-IgG4(P = 0.005), PLA2R-CTLD678-IgG4(P = 0.003), and epitope spreading (P = 0.023) between responders and non-responders in the CTX group. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that higher levels of urinary protein (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26–0.95; P = 0.035) and higher levels of PLA2R-CTLD1-IgG4 (OR, 0.79; 95%CI,0.62–0.99; P = 0.041) were independent risk factors for early remission. A multivariate model for estimating the possibility of early remission in patients with PMN is presented as a nomogram. The AUC-ROC of our model was 0.721 (95%CI, 0.601–0.840), in consistency with the results obtained with internal validation, for which the AUC-ROC was 0.711 (95%CI, 0.587–0.824), thus, demonstrating robustness. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide can induce immunological remission earlier than rituximab at the span of 6 months.

Each batch of intravenous immunoglobulin is required by the Food and Drug Administration to contain threshold levels of measles neutralising antibodies. Widespread use of the measles vaccine has decreased measles antibody potency in the United States plasma supply. There is limited data on measles antibody trough levels in treated primary immunodeficiency patients. The aim of this sub-analysis was to evaluate the measles antibody trough levels in treated primary immunodeficiency patients. METHODS: GMX07 was an open-label, two-period, crossover bioequivalence study which randomized 33 adult patients with primary immunodeficiency disease in 16 centres across the United States, the United Kingdom and Hungary. Eligible adult patients received five infusions of Gammaplex® 5% followed by five infusions of Gammaplex® 10%, or vice versa, on either a 21- or 28-day dosing regimen. The trial included 15 paediatric patients who were not randomized, receiving only five infusions of 10% product. This sub-analysis measured trough levels of measles neutralising antibodies using a Vero cell-based measles virus neutralisation assay. RESULTS: Median measles antibody trough levels were ~\u20091300 mIU/mL with no significant difference between Gammaplex 5% and Gammaplex 10% treatment (p >\u2009 0.9) or the 21-day or 28-day dosing regimen (p >\u2009 0.3). There was also no difference between mean measles neutralising antibody levels following Gammaplex 10% in adult or paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of measles neutralising antibodies in the 5% and 10% formulations of this intravenous immunoglobulin product provided protective antibodies well above accepted thresholds and were similar in adult and paediatric patients across both 21-day and 28-day dosing regimens.

This gradient is pivotal for proper B cell positioning in lymphoid tissue. In the animal model of multiple sclerosis, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the levels of 7α,25OHC rapidly increase in the central nervous system driving the migration of EBI2 expressing immune cells through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To explore if blood vessel cells in the brain express these enzymes, we examined normal mouse brain microvessels and studied changes in their expression during inflammation. Ebi2 was abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, pericytes/smooth muscle cells, and astrocytic endfeet.

The interaction of PD-1 and PD-Ls inhibits T cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) while increasing the function of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). This leads to the evasion of the immune response by tumour cells. The roles of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in endometrial cancer (EC) have not been fully elucidated. This study investigates the mRNA gene expression and soluble protein levels of these molecules in EC compared to controls, with detailed analysis of clinical profiles. The results showed that EC had significantly higher mRNA gene expression and soluble protein levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2, but not PD-1. Specifically, PD-1 mRNA gene expression was significantly higher in cases with less than 50% myometrial invasion. Additionally, the soluble protein level of PD-1 was substantially higher in patients under the age of 60. Higher gene expression of PD-L1 was observed only in advanced stages of EC. However, the soluble PD-L1 protein level was significantly elevated in type II EC, advanced stage, higher grade, lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI), and in cases with myometrial invasion of 50% or more. PD-L2 mRNA gene expression and soluble protein levels significantly differed across all clinical profiles except for LVSI.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness, durability, and safety of 2-DR compared to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (3-DR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational, ambispective study that included all treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experienced (TE) people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), who started 2-DR or 3-DR between 01 July 2018, and 31 January 2022. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority, at 24 and 48 weeks, of 2-DR vs 3-DR regarding the percentage of PLWH with viral load (VL)<50 and 200 copies/mL in TN (12% margin) and VL≥50 and 200 copies/mL in TE (4% margin). Durability of response and safety were also measured. RESULTS: 292 PLWH were included (39 TN and 253 TE). In TN PLWH, non-inferiority was not achieved at 24 weeks (17; 95% CI -17 to 51 p = 0.348). By week 48, all PLWH on 3-DR maintained VL<50 copies/mL compared to 70% of PLWH on 2-DR although without reaching statistical significance (-33; 95% CI -60 to -10 p = 0.289). Non-inferiority was not achieved in TE PLWH either at 24 (0.4; 95% CI -9 to 10 p = 1) or at 48 weeks (4.5; 95% CI -0.5 to 9 p = 0.132). In TN, the risk of treatment discontinuation was similar between groups (HR: 0.31, p = 0.07); similar rates were also found in TE (HR: 1.3, p = 0.38). TE PLWH on 2-DR showed a better safety profile compared to 3-DR (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Our results did not show non-inferiority in terms of virological effectiveness.

METHODS: The credibility and readability of health information was obtained from three search engines. We conducted searches in ""incognito"" mode to reduce the possibility of biases. Quality assessment utilized JAMA benchmarks, the DISCERN tool, and HONcode. Readability was analyzed using the SMOG, FRE, and FKGL indices. RESULTS: Out of 600 websites, 90 were included, with 62.2% affiliated with dental or medical centers, among these websites, 80% exclusively related to dental implant treatments. Regarding JAMA benchmarks, currency was the most commonly achieved and 87.8% of websites fell into the ""moderate quality"" category. Word and sentence counts ranged widely with a mean of 815.7 (±435.4) and 60.2 (±33.3), respectively. FKGL averaging 8.6 (±1.6), SMOG scores averaging 7.6 (±1.1), and FRE scale showed a mean of 58.28 (±9.1), with ""fair difficult"" being the most common category.

frl:6526204,"['INTRODUCTION:\r\nAging brains are characterized by a series of molecular and cellular changes known as aging hallmarks. Among these, a decline in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) marked by reduced clearance and increased protein damage and aggregation has received particular attention as a plausible link between brain aging and those neurodegenerative diseases also characterized by protein aggregation. A notable phenomenon in brain aging is a loss of concordance between mRNA and protein levels, whereby age-linked changes in mRNA do not necessarily lead to proportional changes in protein levels. In this study, we set out to investigate the causes of this “protein-transcript decoupling” and how impaired protein synthesis might contribute to other hallmarks of brain aging.\r\nRATIONALE:\r\nWe used the short-lived African turquoise killifish, which exhibits a naturally compressed life span and accelerated brain aging, to undertake a comprehensive investigation of age-related decline in brain proteostasis. We compared young, adult, and old killifish brains at the levels of amino acid concentrations, tRNAs, mRNAs (transcriptome), actively translated mRNAs (translatome), proteins (proteome), protein modifications [phosphorylation (Ph), ubiquitylation (Ub), and acetylation (Ac)], and protein solubility and subcellular localization. We also tested whether reduced protein degradation caused by proteasome impairment contributes to protein-transcript decoupling and other aging hallmarks in the killifish brain. Our comprehensive design allowed us to pinpoint aging-vulnerable steps in protein biogenesis and reveal mechanisms connecting proteostasis decline to other aging hallmarks.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nWe observed alterations in all molecular signatures investigated, ranging from amino acid concentrations to protein solubility and localization. A clear pattern of proteostasis dysfunction emerged: Although the synthesis of some proteins was enhanced, there was a widespread reduction of proteins enriched in positively charged (basic) amino acids. Notably, many DNA and RNA binding proteins exhibited reduced abundance in old brains, decreasing at the protein but not the transcript levels. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) revealed that brain aging increased ribosome stalling. Accordingly, ribosome collisions were more frequent in old brains. Crucially, stalling events occurred disproportionately on stretches enriched in lysine and arginine codons, thus affecting translation of mRNAs encoding proteins enriched in these basic amino acids, leading to a decline in their protein levels in old brains. Aging-affected proteins included ribosomal subunits and proteins involved in DNA repair, transcription, chromatin maintenance, and RNA splicing and export, which all mediate processes influenced by aging. Ribosome stalling was also associated with increased protein insolubility, likely owing to nascent polypeptide misfolding. Partial proteasome inhibition affected aging hallmarks distinct from those linked to translation dysfunction and primarily influenced lysosomes and mitochondria.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThis work identifies altered translation elongation and impaired protein biogenesis as hallmarks of brain aging in a short-lived vertebrate. Increased ribosome pausing is proposed as a key mechanism contributing to the mismatch between mRNA and protein changes ']",public,['389(6759):478'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4270-8464', 'prefLabel': 'Di Fraia, Domenico'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2786-316X', 'prefLabel': 'Marino, Antonio'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8663-3209', 'prefLabel': 'Lee, Jae Ho'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3336-982X', 'prefLabel': 'Kelmer Sacramento, Erika'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8172-1595', 'prefLabel': 'Baumgart, Mario'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9491-5804', 'prefLabel': 'Bagnoli, Sara'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-0564-8841', 'prefLabel': 'Balla, Till Benedikt'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0633-041X', 'prefLabel': 'Schalk, Felix'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5957-4661', 'prefLabel': 'Kamrad, Stephan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0862-2368', 'prefLabel': 'Guan, Rui'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9928-8283', 'prefLabel': 'Caterino, Cinzia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2lhbm51enppLCBDaGlhcmEg', 'prefLabel': 'Giannuzzi, Chiara '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6320-4885', 'prefLabel': 'Tomaz da Silva, Pedro'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0063-5447', 'prefLabel': 'Sahu, Amit Kumar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3V0LEhhbm5h', 'prefLabel': 'Gut,Hanna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-5631', 'prefLabel': 'Siano, Giacomo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5534-0578', 'prefLabel': 'Tiessen, Max'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3317-1538', 'prefLabel': 'Terzibasi Tozzini, Eva'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7643-4962', 'prefLabel': 'Fornasiero, Eugenio F.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8924-8365', 'prefLabel': 'Gagneur, Julien'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5931-3189', 'prefLabel': 'Englert, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6166-8640', 'prefLabel': 'Patil, Kiran Raosaheb'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6062-1472', 'prefLabel': 'Correia-Melo, Clara'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8598-6021', 'prefLabel': 'Nedialkova, Danny D.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2302-6943', 'prefLabel': 'Frydman, judith'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3834-0097', 'prefLabel': 'Cellerino, Alessandro'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3046-0871', 'prefLabel': 'Ori, Alessandro'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Altered translation elongation contributes to key hallmarks of aging in the killifish brain'],2025-09-19T09:22:38.411+0200,355.0

Emerging evidence suggests that it also possesses potential antidepressant properties. Compared to commonly used clinical antidepressants, lycopene offers higher safety; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the mechanisms through which lycopene exerts its antidepressant effects. We employed the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model to induce depressive-like behaviors in mice, followed by lycopene treatment (20\u2009mg/kg). Based on previous research, we focused on synaptic plasticity by examining the expression of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus to uncover potential mechanisms. The results showed that CSDS induced synaptic plasticity impairments in the hippocampus but lycopene treatment significantly improved these synaptic deficits and reversed the depressive-like behaviors induced by CSDS. Moreover, lycopene treatment upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced the activity of BDNF–TrkB/pTrkB pathway in the hippocampus. These molecular changes were consistent with changes in synaptic-related proteins, suggesting that lycopene may enhance synaptic plasticity via the BDNF–TrkB/pTrkB signaling pathway. This study explored the mechanisms underlying depressive-like behaviors induced by CSDS in mice and provided preclinical evidence that lycopene may serve as a potential antidepressant.

frl:6511250,"['The oviducts (or Fallopian tubes in humans) are central reproductive organs in which the final maturation of germ cells, fertilization and early embryonic development take place. Before fertilization, male gametes bind to the epithelial cells lining the lumen of the proximal part of the oviduct, the isthmus. The epithelial cells build a “reservoir” where the gametes mature, are selected, stored and released in order to provide an optimal number of fertile sperm at the time of ovulation. The molecular mechanisms of oviductal sperm storage and release in cattle are largely unknown. Therefore, the German-French DIALOG project aimed at 1) characterizing the oviductal fluid proteome in spatio-temporal resolution; 2) establishing cell culture models for mechanistic studies in the reservoir; 3) characterizing sperm-epithelium and sperm-fluid interactions; 4) deciphering the mechanisms of sperm-oviduct interactions. The oviductal fluid analysis conducted by the French project partner resulted in the most comprehensive mammalian oviductal fluid proteome published so far and revealed that oviduct region, proximity to the ovulation site and cycle stage largely influence the protein composition of the fluid. Furthermore, sperm-interacting proteins within the oviductal fluid were identified. The DIALOG cooperation partners created compartmentalised air-liquid interface and 3D spheroid models of different regions of the oviduct, which enabled the simulation of oestrus cycle stages and sperm binding studies in vitro. The project partners further developed a protocol for the proteome analysis of samples obtained by laser microdissection from fixed, paraffin-embedded oviduct epithelial tissue. This approach was used to identify new candidate proteins potentially involved in the binding of sperm to the reservoir. The results indicate a coordinated interplay between sperm-interacting proteins in the oviductal fluid and on the epithelial cells. In conclusion, the DIALOG project has provided new insights into the complex, dynamic composition of the bovine sperm reservoir. The models and methods established during the funding period lay the foundation for future comparative studies of the sperm reservoir in species with divergent reproductive strategies, which will serve to improve fertility in domestic animals and support conservation efforts in wildlife species.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Schön, Jennifer', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/129019534'}, {'prefLabel': 'Saint-Dizier, Marie', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1368512682'}, {'prefLabel': 'Leibniz-Institut für Zoo- und Wildtierforschung (Berlin)', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/10174100-5'}, {'prefLabel': ""Institut national de recherche pour l'agriculture, l'alimentation et l'environnement"", '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1240495218'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2007744-0'}, {'prefLabel': 'Frankreich.

The adult PBPK model was established in PK-Sim® using data from 16 clinical studies and was scaled to several pediatric subpopulations. ~93% of the predicted AUClast values in adults and ~88% in pediatrics were within 2-fold of the corresponding value observed. The adult PBPK model predicted a fraction of fentanyl dose metabolized to norfentanyl of ~33% and a fraction excreted in urine of ~7%. In addition, the pediatric PBPK model was used to simulate differences in peak plasma concentrations after bolus injections and short infusions.

Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of health care facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in health care settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies, and health care professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.""]",public,['48(9):1090-1099'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFpbGxhcmQsIEplYW4tWXZlcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Maillard, Jean-Yves'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qmxvb21maWVsZCwgU2FsbHkgRi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bloomfield, Sally F.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q291cnZhbGluLCBQYXRyaWNl', 'prefLabel': 'Courvalin, Patrice'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXNzYWNrLCBTYWJpaGEgWS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Essack, Sabiha Y.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FuZHJhLCBTdW1hbnRo', 'prefLabel': 'Gandra, Sumanth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2VyYmEsIENoYXJsZXMgUC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Gerba, Charles P.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnViaW5vLCBKb3NlcGggUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Rubino, Joseph R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NvdHQsIEVsaXphYmV0aCBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Scott, Elizabeth A.'}]",2020.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Reducing antibiotic prescribing and addressing the global problem of antibiotic resistance by targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings: A position paper'],2025-02-19T13:53:08.461+0100,337.0

frl:6511255,"['Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly in the developed world. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms of this multifactorial diseases are not yet fully understood. The recent progress in retinal imaging have allowed to precisely monitor changes of the laminar structure of the retina with an axial resolution of 5 μm in vivo. Recently, a potential role of altered gut microbiota in age-related eye diseases has been suggested. Such alterations of the gut microbiota may result in elevated blood concentrations of pathogens, antigens and pro-inflammatory molecules including lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- type endotoxins. The aim of my project was to investigate the potential associations of exposure to LPS-type endotoxins with age-related retinal diseases and morphologic changes in the Alienor cohort, a cohort of elderly French community-dwelling people, deeply phenotyped ophthalmologically. In the frame of this project, I reported a significant association between a proxy of LPS-type endotoxin exposure and incident early AMD in the Alienor cohort, suggesting that long term pro-inflammatory exposure to LPS is involved in the early pathophysiological processes of AMD. Further, I also observed a significant association between LPS and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, indicating an involvement of LPS in optic nerve neurodegeneration. Lastly, using longitudinal macular layer thickness data, I could also show that plasma LPS were linked with thinner baseline inner and total macular layers in the Alienor study. An additional in-depth analysis of this longitudinal morphologic data revealed that the retinal pigment epithelium – Bruch’s Membrane complex was associated with incident AMD and with genetic susceptibility to AMD. Taken together, these observations highlight the potential impact of LPS and more general of human microbiota in retinal health.  Infertility is a common disease affecting around 10-15% of all couples. In around one third of cases a male factor is the reason for the couple’s infertility. Azoospermia is the most severe phenotype of male infertility and affected individuals have no chance to reproduce in a natural way. However, they can decide to undergo a testicular biopsy with the aim of testicular sperm extraction. If sperm are gained through the biopsy, these can be used for a medically assisted reproduction. In recent years it was shown that a genetic analysis prior to the biopsy can help to predict the chances of successful sperm retrieval. A crucial gene for male fertility is TEX15. It is involved in the piRNA pathway, which consists of PIWI proteins and small non-coding PIWIinteraction RNAs (piRNAs). This pathway ensures that transposable elements (TEs), which are part of the genome of mammals, are suppressed. This is especially important in foetal germ cells, as these undergo a genetic reprogramming and de novo methylation. This procedure re-activates TEs. The piRNA pathway ensure targeted re-methylation of TE sites. TEX15 is likely involved in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), which ensures long term silencing of TEs. Genetic analyses in infertile men frequently reveal variants in TEX15, which are difficult to interpret. In many cases it remains unknown whether the detected variant is the cause of the man’s infertility. Using a reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells, we tested variants in TEX15 and analysed if the variants impair the function of TEX15 in silencing transposable elements. We found that the variants c.2709_2711del p.(Glu903del) and c.3319G>C p.(Ala1107Pro) did not influence TGS in vitro. In an independent approach, we looked for further genes, which might be involved in the piRNA pathway and associated with azoospermia. Previous experiments have shown that the piRNA factor MIWI2 associates with the protein HSP90AA1. Fittingly, we found the homozygous missense variant c.971G>A p.(Arg324Lys) in HSP90AA1 in an azoospermic man. We created a knock-out mouse line for Hsp90aa1 as well as a knock-in mouse line harbouring the variant found in the infertile man. Our analyses show that mice lacking HSP90AA1 show male specific infertility due to meiotic arrest predominantly at leptotene cell stage. However, HSP90AA1 is not crucial for methylation of TEs in mice as revealed by total RNA-sequencing and enzymatic methylationsequencing of mouse germ cells. Its function in the piRNA pathway is probably redundant with the highly similar HSP90AB1. Our experiments highlight HSP90AA1 as a novel gene associated with azoospermia in humans. If validated, this gene can be included into clinical diagnostic testing of infertile men. We are currently phenotyping the mouse line harbouring the variant found in the azoospermic man, which will likely enable us to describe the first (likely) pathogenic variant in HSP90AA1 in humans.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Larsen, Petra Pei', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1081571276'}, {'prefLabel': 'Bordeaux Population Health Research Centre', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1377791483'}, {'prefLabel': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/2007744-0'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'label': 'Englisch', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The associations of inflammation biomarkers with the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration'],2025-05-09T13:51:19.200+0200,338.0

Beyond vessel patterns and dominances, the potential relation between the vascularization and the motor cortex thickness was studied. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent 7 T MRI scans to map arterial supply and motor cortex at 0.45 mm isotropic resolution. The motor cortex vasculature was segmented manually with vessel-specific labels. VDM was utilized to estimate the vessel-specific supply regions and, subsequently, assess vessel patterns and dominances. Statistical tests were applied to test if the vasculature impacts mean motor cortical thickness estimates. Vessel patterns, that is the presence of supplying vessels, were classified as three-, four-, and five-vessel patterns with a prevalence of 26.3%, 50.0%, and 23.7%, respectively. Vessel dominance, that is the ratio of supply volumes, of the ACA branches showed dominance of the pericallosal artery, callosomarginal artery, and equal contribution, in 34.2%, 34.2%, and 31.6% of the cases, respectively. For the MCA groups, the prevalence of precentral group dominance, central group dominances, and equal contribution was 13.2%, 34.2%, and 52.6%, respectively. Although the central and precentral groups were found in all hemispheres, the postcentral group was found in 28.9% of hemispheres with highly variable supply contribution. Statistical tests returned no significance for the effect of vessel patterns and dominances on the mean motor cortex thickness. With 7 T MRI and VDM, the motor cortex vascularization can be assessed fully noninvasively and longitudinally while providing overall good concordance with previous post mortem studies. Our comprehensive analysis of arterial motor cortex vascularization showed considerable variability between hemispheres, rendering the usage of pattern-specific atlases and analysis more suitable than single normative representations. The successful translation from post mortem to in vivo enables the study of vascular reserve in disorders affecting the motor cortex, such as ALS, and can be translated to other brain regions and neurodegenerative diseases in the future.

In some trials (17%), the cursor was unexpectedly rotated relative to the hand. This rotation was either repeated in the next trial, so that participants could reaim their reach in that trial (2× condition), or the rotation was switched off, preventing reaiming (1× condition; within-subject design). We found a stronger decrease in postmovement beta rebound (PMBR) after the first rotation in the 2× condition, compared to the 1× condition, despite similar movement kinematics. This indicates a role of PMBR in strategic reaiming, and replicates findings from our previous study (Korka et al., 2023). Combining data from the two studies (total N = 52), we found that reaiming accuracy was associated with premovement beta power in the second rotated trial, but not with the PMBR decrease at the end of the first rotated trial. Our results indicate that the decrease in PMBR upon movement error signals the need to adjust a cognitive strategy. Such a role may explain how reduced PMBR in Parkinson's disease could impair discovery of cognitive strategies for movement. Premovement beta power, on the other hand, may be involved in the specification of an aiming strategy following erroneous movement.

frl:6526134,"['BACKGROUND: Predicting future events is a fundamental cognitive ability that often depends on the volatility of the environment. Previous studies on apparent motion reported that when the brain is confronted with low levels of predictability, activity in low-level sensory areas is enhanced, including the primary visual cortex, while others suggest that the enhanced activity in this area is independent of the predictability level. Consequentially, it remains unclear how temporal predictability modulates brain responses in continuous, thus more ecologically valid, motion paradigms. PURPOSE: Our study investigated whether motion extrapolation in high and low predictable contexts would differently modulate fMRI responses in subject-specific primary visual cortex during visible and partially occluded stimulation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen participants performed a modified version of the interception paradigm in visible and occluded phases, in which they observed a stimulus moving horizontally, then vertically at two different velocities, while fMRI data was acquired. They judged when and where the stimulus would reach a given point of contact. In a high predictable context, the velocity was identical during horizontal and vertical (occluded) movement; whereas, in a low predictable context, the velocity could change during the vertical trajectory, introducing a temporal incongruence to the task with a predictive role of velocity on the trajectory estimation.\r\nRESULTS: Univariate results indicated that on average both low and high predictable contexts similarly modulated activity in primary visual areas. On the other hand, trial-history analysis showed that a change in trial type (constant velocity after change in velocity and vice versa) increased BOLD responses in V1. CONCLUSION: This pattern of results suggests that motion extrapolation can modulate activity in the primary visual cortex regardless of average predictability but is influenced by recent trial history. These results were further supported by multivariate pattern analysis, which revealed different patterns when comparing congruent and incongruent trials in the context of lower predictability.

Recent studies identified excessive glutamate accumulation as a key Aβ-dependent determinant of hyperactivity. The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity. Thus, we suggest that synaptic decoupling is an Aβ-dependent cellular mechanism underlying progressive neuronal silencing and a critical factor for the cognitive impairments encountered in AD.

Although psoralen and isopsoralen have been used as dietary supplements because of their bioactivities such as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties; however, the potential mechanisms underlying the antioxidant activities of these two furocoumarins still need to be explored. Hence, the aims of this work were to examine the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by psoralen and isopsoralen, as well as the binding interaction of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) with these two furocoumarins. Interestingly, both psoralen and isopsoralen induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells. These two furanocoumarins also activated antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven luciferase activity. The mRNA expression of GCLM, HO-1, and NQO1 genes was significantly upregulated by treatment of HEK293T cells with psoralen and isopsoralen, respectively. Similarly, the expression of proteins can be promoted. Both psoralen and isopsoralen were located in the top of the central pocket of the Keap1 Kelch domain, suggesting that they were natural ligands of Keap1. In conclusion, both psoralen and isopsoralen activate Nrf2 through interaction with Keap1, thereby serving as natural antioxidants.']",public,['13(1):e4768'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THYsIENoZW5neXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Lv, Chengyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgU29uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Song'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VuLCBDaGFuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Sun, Chang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgWWloYW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Yihao'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5635-8560', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Chao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVhbiwgQ3VpcGluZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Yuan, Cuiping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UWluLCBGZW5neGlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Qin, Fengxian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9809-4433', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Tiezhu'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Psoralen and Isopsoralen Activate Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 Through Interaction With Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1'],2025-09-30T12:46:11.174+0200,286.0

In neurophysiological recordings, LIP neurons exhibit motor response fields spatially distinct from their sensory receptive field. Different associations of motor response and receptive fields in single neurons tile visual space. Ventral LIP neurons tend to have motor response fields distant from their sensory receptive fields.

The study was conducted with 385 individuals with type 2 diabetes at a training and research hospital between August and November 2023. Data on general information, biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, 24-h dietary recall, and food frequency questionnaire were collected. The EAT-Lancet Diet Index was used to classify dietary adherence. Of the participants, 52.7% were female, and the mean age was 54.42 (SD 11.53) years. Higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with higher dietary fiber intake and lower total energy, protein, and fat intake. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between the EAT-Lancet Diet Index and diabetes duration (p\u2009=\u20090.03), while a negative correlation was found between the index and fasting blood glucose levels (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Participants with higher adherence also had better glycemic control and lower HbA1c levels. Sociodemographic factors such as age influenced dietary adherence, with older individuals showing higher adherence. It is concluded that adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet is significantly associated with improved glycemic control and better health outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Promoting this sustainable diet through policy interventions and educational programs can enhance public health and environmental sustainability.

frl:6526292,"['PURPOSE: Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and microsatellite instability are predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response. The best approach to identify patients with such tumors is unclear in prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study included 1,016 men diagnosed with primary prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians’ Health Study. The highest-grade/index lesions from radical prostatectomy (95%) or transurethral resections of the prostate were mounted on tissue microarrays. Scoring of immunohistochemistry for the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 required a nontumor internal positive control for designating deficiency. Validation was done on full sections and with PCR-based quantification of microsatellite repeats. RESULTS: Tumor stage was predominantly pathologically localized with a full distribution of Gleason scores. MMR tumor scoring could be performed with available internal positive control tissue in 75% to 90% of cases, depending on the MMR protein. Of the 903 tumors evaluable for MSH2 protein loss, 4 tumors had loss of MSH2 (prevalence, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2%–1.1%), and 3 of 708 evaluable tumors had concomitant loss of MSH6 (prevalence, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1%–1.2%). No tumor had loss of MLH1 or PMS2. The four MMR-deficient cases had higher Gleason scores, and three had non-zero microsatellite repeats. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide prospective study, MMR deficiency was rare in primary, surgically treated prostate cancer. The low prevalence and the need for an internal positive control for this assay are feasibility concerns for unselected routine immunohistochemistry-based screening for MMR deficiency on limited tissue specimens, such as prostate biopsies.']",public,['31(9):1746-1753'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3587-4018', 'prefLabel': 'McNevin, Ciara'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2187-1126', 'prefLabel': 'Keogh, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8616-146X', 'prefLabel': 'Mohammed Nur, Mutaz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0000-4733-9165', 'prefLabel': 'McGovern, Brianan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0004-7938-7064', 'prefLabel': 'Mc Fadden, Julie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7501-1159', 'prefLabel': 'Baird, Anne-Marie'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8384-7148', 'prefLabel': 'Cadoo, Karen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-6598-1769', 'prefLabel': 'McCarron, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9099-7462', 'prefLabel': ""O'Brien, Cathal""}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5202-9655', 'prefLabel': 'Barr, Martin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5850-6392', 'prefLabel': 'Gray, Steven'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4493-9496', 'prefLabel': 'Sheils, Orla'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-5097-0574', 'prefLabel': 'Sutton, Lesley Ann'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8690-792X', 'prefLabel': 'Flanagan, Sinead'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2551-4927', 'prefLabel': 'Mucci, Lorelei'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0722-1311', 'prefLabel': 'Stopsack, Konrad H.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8628-5814', 'prefLabel': 'Finn, Stephen'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Prevalence of mismatch repair deficiency in primary prostate cancer in a large prospective cohort'],2025-10-15T14:08:08.124+0200,266.0

A recent example is the COVID-19 pandemic, where a better understanding of the virus’ transmission dynamics as well as preventive and therapeutic options would have improved public health and medical decision-making.

frl:6510016,"['BACKGROUND: Although daily time-use is associated with diet quality and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in children, their interdependence remains unexplored. This study first examined the associations between reallocating daily movement time and diet quality and CRF, and second the mediating role of diet quality in the relationship between daily time-use and CRF. METHODS: This study included 1131 Chinese children (aged 8 to 10 years; median [interquartile range]: 8.5 [8.3, 8.8]) at baseline (September 2022) and 1268 children at the 9-month follow-up (June 2023) from the OptiChild study. Daily durations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sleep, and sedentary behavior (e.g., screen time) were self-reported or proxy-reported by parents. Diet quality was assessed via the Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ), which uses a 24 h dietary recall and is categorized according to the Global Dietary Recommendations (GDR) score and Food Group Diversity Score (FGDS). The CRF was measured using VO2max after the 20 m shuttle run test. Longitudinal associations between daily time-use, diet quality, and CRF were calculated using isotemporal substitution models. Mediation analyses were used to determine whether diet quality mediated the associations between daily time-use and CRF. RESULTS: Reallocation of 30 min from screen time to MVPA resulted in significant improvements in the GDR score (β baseline = 0.11, p = 0.024; β follow-up = 0.26, p < 0.001), FGDS (β baseline = 0.11, p = 0.006; β follow-up = 0.19, p < 0.001), and CRF (β baseline = 0.40, p < 0.001; β follow-up = 0.26, p = 0.001). Diet quality partially mediated the associations between MVPA, screen time, and CRF. Substituting 30 min of screen time for MVPA led to diet quality mediating a proportion of the association with CRF (GDR score: 11.4%, FGDS: 6.6%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of optimizing daily time-use of MVPA and screen time and improving diet quality to promote physical fitness in school-aged children.']",public,['16(16):2788'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWW91eGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Youxin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFBpbmdwaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Pingping'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgTWluZ3V5ZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Minguye'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R29uZywgUWluZ2hhaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Gong, Qinghai'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIENhbnFpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Canqing'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0849-2903', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Hai-Jun'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7354-5958', 'prefLabel': 'Hebestreit, Antje'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGF1LCBQYXRyaWNrIFcuIEMu', 'prefLabel': 'Lau, Patrick W.

frl:6509987,"['BACKGROUND: Previous studies have repeatedly reported alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in patients after bariatric surgery (BS). This research field can benefit from studies combining health claims data with survey data. METHODS: Based on a combined retrospective cohort and cross-sectional study, 2151 patients with BS identified in a large health claims database received a questionnaire, by which we assessed the presence of AUDs based on a validated instrument (AUDIT) as well as by ICD-10 codes from the health claims data. We described patients with vs. without AUDs regarding sex, time since surgery, satisfaction with weight loss and health care resource utilization (HCRU). RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (80.7%) with a median time since surgery of 6 years (Interquartile range: 4–9 years). For the majority of patients, the bariatric intervention was either a RYGB-Bypass (50%) or sleeve gastrectomy (43%). Overall, 3% had at least one AUD diagnosis code in the claims data (men: 5.5%, women: 2.5%). Among men, 43.6% of diagnoses were coded after but not before the surgery (women: 52%). According to AUDIT (completed by 1496 patients), 9.4% of all patients showed at least hazardous/harmful alcohol consumption.

Interestingly, despite experiencing similar amounts of stress than those falling ill, some individuals are protected against the 'wear and tear of daily life'. Based on the notion that mindfulness training strengthens stress resilience, we explored whether facets of trait mindfulness, prior to training intervention, are linked to acute psychosocial stress reactivity and chronic stress load. To assess different mindfulness facets, over 130 participants completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). For acute stress induction, a standardized psychosocial stress test was conducted. Subjective stress, sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis end hormone cortisol were assessed repeatedly. Additionally, levels of hair cortisol and cortisone as indices of the long-term physiological stress load were collected. We found differential associations of different facets of mindfulness with subjective stress, cortisol, and hair cortisone levels. Specifically, the trait mindfulness facets FMI 'Acceptance' and the ability to put one's inner experience into words (FFMQ 'Describing') were associated with lower acute subjective and cortisol stress reactivity. Contrarily, monitoring-related trait mindfulness facets (FFMQ 'Acting with Awareness' and 'Observing') were associated with higher acute cortisol and marginally higher long-term cortisone release. Our results suggest granularity of the mindfulness construct. In accordance with the 'Monitor and Acceptance Theory', especially acceptance-related traits buffered against stress, while monitoring-related traits seemed to be maladaptive in the context of stress. The current results give valuable guidance for the conceptualization of mindfulness-based interventions geared towards stress reduction.""]",public,['166:107051'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FsbGlzdGwsIE1hdGhpbGRl', 'prefLabel': 'Gallistl, Mathilde'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlueiwgUm9tYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Linz, Roman'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHVobG1hbm4sIExhcmEgTS5DLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Puhlmann, Lara M.C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2luZ2VyLCBUYW5pYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Singer, Tania'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RW5nZXJ0LCBWZXJvbmlrYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Engert, Veronika'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Evidence for differential associations of distinct trait mindfulness facets with acute and chronic stress'],2025-01-29T08:11:43.088+0100,336.0

However, the mapping of changes provided by many imaging approaches often lacks specificity with respect to biological tissue properties, which is relevant for treatment optimization and the evaluation of health-promoting lifestyle factors. Training-induced structural changes in cortical and subcortical gray matter likely reflect a mixture of various microstructural processes. In order to non-invasively map these different microstructural contributions, we used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) to measure clinically-relevant brain tissue property changes (such as iron, myelin, and water) in response to 4 weeks of motor balance training in 26 healthy young adults. Training resulted in a regionally-specific decrease in myelin-related magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat) in the left frontal cortex. We also found performance-related changes in iron-sensitive transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in visual cortical (signal increase along with positive performance correlation) and limbic subcortical (signal decrease along with negative performance correlation) brain areas. Our study contributes to a growing body of literature investigating motor training-induced microstructural brain plasticity.

frl:6489615,"[""Resilience has been defined as the maintenance or quick recovery of mental health during and after stressor exposure. One popular operationalization of this concept is to model prototypical trajectories of mental health in response to an adverse event, where trajectories of undisturbed low or rapidly recovering symptoms both comply with the resilience definition. However, mental health responses are likely also influenced by other stressors occurring before or during the observation time window. These 'background' stressors may affect a person's assignment to a trajectory class. When using these classes as dependent variables to identify resilience-predictive factors, this may lead to false estimates. A new method to build exposure-controlled trajectories based on time courses of stressor reactivity (SR), rather than pure mental health scores, is demonstrated on a data set of 707 initially healthy participants living in Germany (67.33% female; Mage = 29.20, SD = 8.27). SR scores express individual deviations from the sample's normative mental health reaction to observed real-life stressors during the observation time window, thus accounting for individual differences in exposure to background stressors. The resulting trajectory models are plausible. In analyses additionally controlling for background stressors occurring before the observation time window (past life events), low SR trajectories are predicted by the well-documented resilience factor sense of coherence, suggesting construct validity. Further, they are associated with lower odds of developing categorical mental health conditions, suggesting predictive validity. Our study provides the first proof of principle for a refined method to identify predictors of resilience to major stressor events.

The current study was conducted to investigate how different tillage (disc harrow, chisel, no tillage) and organic fertilizer (Antep radish and broccoli chopped residue, olive blackwater) treatments affect the concentration of these valuable compounds in Royal grape berries over three consecutive years (2020–2022), providing insights into optimal agricultural practices for enhancing grape quality. Our results documented significant variations in phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations across different soil tillage, organic fertilizer treatments and years. Among the soil treatments, the disc harrow treatment emerged as the most effective in increasing the levels of most phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, while the broccoli fertilizer treatment was identified as the superior fertilizer application for achieving the same goal. Excluding disc harrow and broccoli fertilizer treatments, other treatments such as no tillage and chisel tillage, and fertilizers like olive blackwater and Antep radish, showed variable effectiveness. These treatments, although less effective overall than the leading treatments, contributed to increased levels of certain compounds such as resveratrol and pterostilbene, indicating their specific benefits. The findings also indicated specific combinations of tillage and fertilizer treatments that maximized the accumulation of certain phenolic compounds, like the combination of no tillage with broccoli fertilizer, which was particularly effective in increasing the levels of vanillic acid and trans-caffeic acid. To sum up, by adopting practices such as disc harrow tillage and broccoli fertilizer application, viticulturists can enhance the phenolic and anthocyanin profiles of grapes, thus improving their nutritional value and potentially the quality of grape and wine produced from these grapes.']",public,['12(11):9428-9442'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1679-6125', 'prefLabel': 'kaya, ozkan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QXRlcywgRmFkaW1l', 'prefLabel': 'Ates, Fadime'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFsZXIsIFNlbGRh', 'prefLabel': 'Daler, Selda'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FudHVyaywgU2V2aWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Canturk, Sevil'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHVyYW4sIE1ldGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Turan, Metin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGF0dGVybWFuLVZhbGVudGksIEhhcmxlbmU=', 'prefLabel': 'Hatterman-Valenti, Harlene'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Optimizing Grape Quality Through Tillage and Organic Fertilization: A Comprehensive Analysis of Phenolic and Anthocyanin Variability Over Three\u2009Years'],2025-05-07T10:34:28.247+0200,286.0

Since the 19th century’s observation that infections can slow neoplastic growth and the discovery of viruses soon after, oncolytic virotherapy has continuously gained interest. Objective. The history and current state of Oncolytic Virus (OV) research, clinical development, and therapeutic availability is assessed and evaluated. Methods. Relevant publications summarizing OV research and development were reviewed. Numbers of trials and publications were taken from the publicly available data bases ClinicalTrials.Gov and PubMed. Results. Therapeutic virus research made significant progress with the advent of genetic engineering techniques. At the same time, elucidation of immunological mechanisms paved the way for targeted approaches. Today, four OVs are approved for cancer treatment, and a plethora of genetically modified OVs are in development. Oncotropism, tumour penetration, replication and multimodal triggering of anti-tumour immunogenicity form the basis of their efficacy. Oncolytic viruses are modified to target cancer cells, escape intratumoral control mechanisms, express specific binding sites, transcribe immunogenic cytokines and antibodies, and re-invigorate the tumour microenvironment (TME). Conclusion. An immense body of preclinical and phase-1 clinical data vastly confirms OV safety even though treatment benefit often is weak. Future research needs to focus on open questions of e.g. virus, patient and indication selection, modes of administration, and most promising cargos.']",public,['27(1):34-41'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2zDvGdsaWNoLCBNYXR0aGlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Klüglich, Matthias'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Oncolytic viruses – coming closer to breakthrough'],2025-05-14T13:28:42.848+0200,338.0
frl:6511069,"[""Background of the study- Apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) production faces significant challenges, with biennial (or alternate) bearing being a major obstacle to stable yields. Natural high crop load (ON-year) considerably reduces return bloom in the following year resulting in low yields (OFF- year) that significantly diminish the profitability of apple production. Previous studies suggested that growing apples may export some unknown signaling molecule(s) to the adjacent bourse buds and thereby inhibit flower bud formation. Objectives- This study addresses the role of tryptophan as a potential signal that triggers biennial bearing. Previously, we found that bourse buds of high-cropping 'Fuji' and 'Gala' trees contain more tryptophan compared to bourse buds of the trees with no crop load. This led to the hypothesis that tryptophan is exported from the growing apples and accumulates in the adjacent bourse buds where it potentially inhibits flower initiation, or further metabolizes to melatonin, which may act as an inhibitor of flower bud formation. Methods- We tested our hypothesis by measuring the export of tryptophan from 'Fuji' and 'Gala' apples. Besides, we carried out foliar applications with tryptophan on 'Nicoter' and 'Gala' trees. In addition, we checked whether tryptophan or melatonin affect the continuous-flowering habit of RNAi transgenic apple plantlets with silenced expression of MdTFL1 cultivated in vitro. Results- Our data shows that growing apple fruits of 'Fuji and 'Gala' export tryptophan. However, foliar applications with this compound did not affect return bloom in 'Nicoter' or 'Gala. Finally, neither tryptophan nor melatonin suppressed flowering of MdTFL1-1 RNAi transgenic apple plantlets in vitro. Conclusions- Although the transport of tryptophan from apple fruits to adjacent bourse buds cannot be excluded, we reject the hypothesis on an inhibitory effect of tryptophan and its downstream metabolic product melatonin on flower bud formation in apple.""]",public,['89(6):10'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWlseWFldiwgQQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Milyaev, A'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xhaWJlciwgSQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Klaiber, I'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7511-0779', 'prefLabel': 'Tandron Moya, Yudelsy Antonia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVtcGV0LCBK', 'prefLabel': 'Lempet, J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGZhbm5zdGllbCwgSg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pfannstiel, J'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVlZGVsaW5nLCBF', 'prefLabel': 'Luedeling, E'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-425X', 'prefLabel': 'von Wirén, Nicolaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmxhY2hvd3NreSwgSA==', 'prefLabel': 'Flachowsky, H'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Exploring the role of tryptophan in biennial bearing: A mobile molecule that is exported from growing apples but does not suppress flowering'],2025-04-15T11:30:56.322+0200,325.0

This condition can cause severe functional limitations as well as significant aesthetic concerns. Treatment for TED patients aims to restore functionality and address aesthetic concerns. Surgical TED treatment is usually performed by orbital wall resection, which effectively decompresses intraorbital tissues and corrects the orbital/ocular disorders. Several different scenarios of surgical TED treatment including one-, two-, and three-wall resections are known. More recently, a new minimally invasive technique, the so-called lateral valgization (LAVA) of the orbital wall, was reported to show promising results comparable to conventional wall resection techniques. Due to the relatively limited data on TED treatment, only a few quantitative investigations of alternative TED surgery scenarios exist. In this feasibility study, we estimate the soft tissue outcome of LAVA treatment using computational simulation. Our experimental results show that the amount of intraorbital tissue released into the extraorbital space by LAVA treatment is comparable with the outcome of two-wall resection.

The proposed model begins by leveraging the visual geometry group (VGG-16) network to extract initial pixel-based spatial features from the crop images. These features are then further refined using the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) model and feature decomposition-based matrix factorization mechanism, which generates more informative features for classification purposes.

To obtain its socio-ecological implications for policy-making, we developed regionally specific agricultural scenarios (compensation payments, livestock capacity, hey export, and bioenergy production) and an interdisciplinary modelling approach that made it possible to simulate agricultural land use changes through land managers' responses to varied economic conditions. Through this approach, we found that some economic factors hampered the use of SNGLs: the moderate profitability of beef production, labour shortages, and the relatively high profitability of mulching. We observed a positive relationship between SNGLs and habitat suitability for breeding and feeding birds. However, due to the high maintenance costs of SNGLs, the modelling results indicated that increasing the use of SNGLs through public budgets caused crowding-out effects, i.e., the deteriorating market integration of regional agriculture.

However, a significant obstacle to its adoption is the potential trade-off between ecosystem services and optimizing yields. We used a two year, on-farm study in Eastern Germany to test how different spatial arrangements of soy (Glycine max L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can affect pest abundance, aphid predation, and natural enemy biodiversity as well as yields. We compared conventional sole cropping to three types of spatially diversified cropping systems: relay intercropping, wide strip cropping, and patch cropping. Strip cropping generally supported some of the highest levels of carabid abundance both years and spider abundance in 2022 without any yield penalties. While the relay system failed due to insufficient precipitation, strip cropping produced similar or higher yields than sole cropping (124\u202f% and 96\u202f% of the sole wheat yield and 96\u202f% and 109\u202f% of sole soy yield in 2022 and 2023, respectively). Strip cropping supported significantly more carabid beetles compared to sole cropped soy both years and sole cropped wheat in 2022.

One of the most apparent consequences of environmental alterations is the occurrence of climatic changes. The city of Joinville is situated in the southern region of Brazil. It has achieved a notable position at the national level, largely due to the significant presence of large-scale industrial operations in the metal-mechanical, plastic, and textile sectors. This study aimed to assess the effects of urban environments on Nectandra oppositifolia plants and lichen communities using a passive biomonitoring approach, and on Tetragonisca angustula stingless bees using an active biomonitoring approach. This study demonstrated a pronounced effect of anthropogenic activities on plant anatomy and morphology (higher leaf area, fresh mass, dry mass, and water content in the urban-industrial site), with higher metal concentrations in leaf particulate matter (3.14 ± 0.4 μg cm−2). The diversity of lichens was the lowest, whereas that of crustose lichens was the highest in industrial-urban and residential-rural sites (industrial-urban site = 13 species, residential-rural site = 29 species, control site = 33 species, p < 0.05). The distribution of species within the lichen communities was inversely correlated with the degree of anthropogenic influence. Some lichen species were found exclusively in the control areas, suggesting that they may indicate good environmental quality (Arthonia sp., Astrothelium sp., Phyllopsora pyxinoides, Phyllopsis sp., and others). Beehive pollen analysis revealed the presence of Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Pb, and industrial-urban site exhibited higher metal concentrations (particularly, Ni, 12.59 ± 0.9, and Cr, 3.76 ± 1.00, mg kg−1). This approach highlights the environmental repercussions that affect the Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia kingdoms. The use of biomonitoring as a robust tool in good environmental quality assessment provides insight into policy decisions and underscores the importance of pollution studies.']",public,['6(10):2515-7620'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3991-2299', 'prefLabel': 'Bonatti Chaves, Mariane'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFjYWxvc3NpLCBKZW5pZmVy', 'prefLabel': 'Macalossi, Jenifer'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-3865-5335', 'prefLabel': 'Dümes Chaves Cabral, Rodrigo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-3803', 'prefLabel': 'Dias dos Santos, Murylu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGZ1bmRuZXIsIFBhbWVsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Pfundner, Pamela'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8511-5365', 'prefLabel': 'BONATTI, MICHELLE'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4849-7277', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2816-9532', 'prefLabel': 'Medeiros, Sandra Helena Westrupp'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0695-0467', 'prefLabel': ', '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1237-2050', 'prefLabel': 'Gumboski, Emerson Luiz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6800-5508', 'prefLabel': 'Melo-Júnior, Joao Carlos Ferreira'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Assessing ecosystem resilience: effects of different environments on native flora, lichens and bee pollen in a mid-sized Brazilian city']",2025-05-19T09:16:10.958+0200,333.0

While most studies have focused on the spatial and temporal analysis of landscape changes using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, there has been less emphasis on the socioeconomic analysis of these changes. Understanding the socioeconomic dynamics of affected areas is essential for implementing practical corrective actions. We apply linear programming and welfare maximization theory to examine how population growth impacts competition between agriculture and forest land use, per capita cash income, and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms. Focusing on the Tchamba district in Togo, we aim to determine the sustainability of farming systems to better inform the ongoing Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) program. The findings show that the current agricultural systems can support the population growth rate (2.68% per year in the Tchamba district) and per capita income until at least 2063. However, the current agricultural systems cannot support one human generation, which is estimated to be 65\u2009years. These results underscore the need to enhance farming technologies, boost land productivity, diversify income sources to meet the rising food demand and curb forest clearing for farmland expansion. By integrating these insights into the FLR program, this research highlights the importance of a comprehensive policy framework that supports sustainable agricultural practices, community engagement, enforcement of regulations, and economic diversification. This approach will guide restoration efforts and strengthen the resilience and productivity of agricultural systems under population and income pressures.']",public,[' 8:1466008'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5067-2871', 'prefLabel': 'Moluh Njoya, Hamza '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0212-7331', 'prefLabel': 'HOUNKPATI, Kossi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8491-8107', 'prefLabel': 'Kossi, Adjonou'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2400-0852', 'prefLabel': 'KOKOU, Kouami'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4849-7277', 'prefLabel': 'Sieber, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2691-9712', 'prefLabel': 'Löhr, Katharina'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Socioeconomic analysis of deforestation and economically sustainable farming systems to foster forest landscape restoration in central Togo'],2025-05-15T14:52:07.217+0200,333.0

In Germany, official spatial planning allows the use of priority and reserved areas to secure land for agricultural use and regional food supply. The focus should be particularly on climate-resilient areas that also have a stable yield potential in the future. This paper supplements widely used, static approaches for determining priority and reserved areas with a dynamic bio-economic analysis that takes future climate scenarios into account. The results for the German federal state of Brandenburg show a high area equivalence between the static and dynamic approaches. In the case of data gaps, for example, static approaches such as soil quality indices can serve as an adequate proxy for future yield potentials. However, not all climate-robust areas can be classified as potential reserved or priority areas. Furthermore, areas that show low yield potential under future conditions are not released for other land uses. Feedback from stakeholders involved in the study showed that the use of the dynamic approach and a target value using the results of a foodshed model lead to broad acceptance. The method developed here can make a valuable contribution to climate change adaptation in spatial planning instruments.']",public,['82(4):338-351'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0852-6754', 'prefLabel': 'von Czettritz, Hannah Jona'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2527-7052', 'prefLabel': 'Uthes, Sandra'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4944-9613', 'prefLabel': 'Schuler, Johannes'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3514-4592', 'prefLabel': 'Steinhäußer, Reimund'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3679-8427', 'prefLabel': 'Kersebaum, Kurt Christian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4905-2971', 'prefLabel': 'Zander, Peter'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Classification of agricultural priority and reserved areas in Brandenburg under consideration of bio-economic climate simulations'],2025-02-05T09:30:21.304+0100,333.0

frl:6511754,"['Information on tropical Asian vertebrates has traditionally been sparse, particularly when it comes to cryptic species inhabiting the dense forests of the region. Vertebrate populations are declining globally due to land-use change and hunting, the latter frequently referred as “defaunation.” This is especially true in tropical Asia where there is extensive land-use change and high human densities. Robust monitoring requires that large volumes of vertebrate population data be made available for use by the scientific and applied communities. Camera traps have emerged as an effective, non-invasive, widespread, and common approach to surveying vertebrates in their natural habitats. However, camera-derived datasets remain scattered across a wide array of sources, including published scientific literature, gray literature, and unpublished works, making it challenging for researchers to harness the full potential of cameras for ecology, conservation, and management. In response, we collated and standardized observations from 239 camera trap studies conducted in tropical Asia. There were 278,260 independent records of 371 distinct species, comprising 232 mammals, 132 birds, and seven reptiles. The total trapping effort accumulated in this data paper consisted of 876,606 trap nights, distributed among Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Bhutan, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Nepal, and far eastern India. The relatively standardized deployment methods in the region provide a consistent, reliable, and rich count data set relative to other large-scale pressence-only data sets, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) or citizen science repositories (e.g., iNaturalist), and is thus most similar to eBird. To facilitate the use of these data, we also provide mammalian species trait information and 13 environmental covariates calculated at three spatial scales around the camera survey centroids (within 10-, 20-, and 30-km buffers). We will update the dataset to include broader coverage of temperate Asia and add newer surveys and covariates as they become available.

For non-domestic felids held in human care, the effect of body condition on male fertility has not been studied, although obesity is a recognized problem for many species such as the African lion (Panthera leo) under captive conditions.\r\nHere, we assessed body weight, body condition via body condition score (BCS), reproductive organ appearance and size by ultrasonography and semen parameters as a function of age in a large population of captive male lions housed in different facilities in South Africa. Of 59 individuals (age range 2.5–10 years), we rated 21 (36\u202f%) of the males (≥ 4 years) as highly obese (BCS 8–9). Semen collection via urethral catheter was successful in 49 males (83.0\u202f%). Sperm were found in 44 males (74.6\u202f%) across all age groups. Sperm motility and detailed sperm morphology was assessed in 42 and 18 lions, respectively.\r\nAs expected, body weight and reproductive organ size increased with age, but only the testis size increased in proportion to BCS. Although our data are unbalanced, as older animals (already after five years of age) were more often obese, they suggest an optimum age and body condition for potential fertility with adequate physical maturity in male lions. Physical maturity appeared to be reached between the ages of three and five years, which is later than sexual maturity in male lions.\r\nLions that far exceeded the normal body weight range and had a BCS of 8 or 9 had lower semen quantity and quality. Therefore, male lions in captivity are in prime breeding condition when physical maturity is combined with a BCS < 8.\r\nOur data contribute towards interpretation of fertility assessments in managed breeding programs for lions. Ultrasonographic appearance of the reproductive organs, BCS and semen parameters can help to identify and select breeding males.']",public,['5:100093'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVlZGVycywgSW1rZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Lueders, Imke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmV1a2VuLCBKb2hhbm5h', 'prefLabel': 'Reuken, Johanna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THV0aGVyLCBJbHNl', 'prefLabel': 'Luther, Ilse'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIGRlciBIb3JzdCwgR2VyaGFyZA==', 'prefLabel': 'van der Horst, Gerhard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S290emUsIEFudG9pbmV0dGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Kotze, Antoinette'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VG9yZGlmZmUsIEFkcmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Tordiffe, Adrian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2llbWUsIEhhcmFsZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Sieme, Harald'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFrb3AsIFVscmlrZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Jakop, Ulrike'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TXVlbGxlciwgS2FyaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Mueller, Karin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Effect of age and body condition score on reproductive organ size and sperm parameters in captive male African lion (Panthera leo): Suggesting a prime breeding age'],2025-06-12T07:31:50.490+0200,336.0

Understanding population dynamics under different conditions is important but it is challenging to allocate limited effort to spatial and temporal subpopulation monitoring. Using GLMMs, we analyze survey data of a metapopulation of coconut crabs spanning 7\u2009years and 15 sites in and near the Pemba archipelago, Zanzibar, to estimate trends in population size (based on catch per unit effort), weight and sex ratio at the meta- and subpopulation level and investigate anthropogenic drivers of these trends. We found that the overall metapopulation has remained stable in terms of size and composition over the survey period, but observed diverging trends in population size and sex ratio at some subpopulations. Formal protection of sites was associated with positive population trends. Of nine sites for which we could estimate site-specific trends, three showed increasing and two decreasing trends, whereas four sites had stable subpopulations. Although anthropogenic factors affected the average weight, and the incidence of small and large individuals, we found no temporal trends in any weight-related measures. Furthermore, there were no apparent patterns between weight-related measures and subpopulation trends. The metapopulation was biased toward males, and exploitation appeared to be associated with declining trends in the proportion of females, likely an artifact of a strong decline in the proportion of females in one of only two exploited sites in the dataset. Educational campaigns implemented in 2020 at six sites were not related to higher population sizes in later surveys. The variable trends in subpopulation sizes and composition highlight the need for spatially replicated monitoring in metapopulations. The analyses further provide a detailed baseline for future subpopulation studies of this vulnerable species in one of its last remaining metapopulations in the Western Indian Ocean.']",public,['14(8):e70168'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sbG1hbm4sIFJhaGVs', 'prefLabel': 'Sollmann, Rahel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6804-8519', 'prefLabel': 'Caro, Tim'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Spatio‐temporal metapopulation trends: The coconut crabs of Zanzibar'],2025-06-12T07:48:10.117+0200,336.0

We used a geospatial distribution modeling approach to predict the spatial allocation of camera trap research on terrestrial mammals and to identify its key correlates. We show that camera trap research over the past two decades has not targeted areas where defaunation risk is highest and that 76.8% of the global research allocation can be attributed to country income, biome, terrestrial mammal richness, and accessibility. The lowest probabilities of camera trap research allocation occurred in low-income countries. The Amazon and Congo Forest basins – two highly biodiverse ecosystems facing unprecedented anthropogenic alteration – received inadequate camera trap research attention. Even within the best covered regions, most of the research (64.2%) was located outside the top 20% areas where defaunation risk was greatest.

frl:6511797,"['Understanding drivers of species distributions is a central theme in ecology, and species are known to respond to drivers at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Yet, little attention has been paid to the temporal dimensions of predictors of species abundance or occurrence. Studies considering lagged responses typically contrast few points in time, rather than integrating multiple temporal scales. Here, I transfer an approach developed for the integration of predictors across spatial scales into the temporal realm. In this approach, a weighted mean predictor is used in a generalized linear model for abundance or occurrence; weights are estimated for each temporal scale based on a parametric function, and the parameters defining the function are estimated within the model. In a simulation study using a half-normal declining weight function, I show that the scale parameter σ (measuring temporal scale of response) and effect strength of the predictor, β, can be estimated accurately in abundance models with and without imperfect detection for a range of sample sizes and input values of σ and β. Accuracy for both parameters was lower in occurrence-based models. Estimates of σ improved in accuracy with increasing β, and precision of both estimates tended to be lower in models with imperfect detection. A higher resolution time series of predictor values improved estimates of both parameters, and lower detection probability most strongly increased bias in β in occurrence models. The approach can be viewed as a more parsimonious but less flexible case of memory models or distributed lag models. It is easily incorporated into standard methods used to model animal abundance and occurrence and therefore hopefully will open up avenues for future research into lagged responses in wildlife distribution to environmental conditions.']",public,['15(1):e4704'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1607-2039', 'prefLabel': 'Sollmann, Rahel'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Estimating the temporal scale of lagged responses in species abundance and occurrence'],2025-06-12T07:47:34.615+0200,336.0

One proposed mechanism for the reallocation of resources is a trade-off with the immune function and the regulation of oxidative status. Relying on a panel of blood-based markers of immune function and oxidative status quantified in an invasive species (Egyptian goose) and two native competing species (mallard and mute swan) in Germany, we tested the hypothesis that the invasive species would have (i) lower investment in immune function, (ii) lower levels of oxidative damage, and (iii) no higher antioxidant defences compared to the native species. We found lower levels of adaptive immune markers (lymphocytes and immunoglobulin Y), in the invasive species compared to the two native species. Reactive oxygen metabolites, a marker of oxidative damage, were also lower in Egyptian geese compared to the other species, while levels of antioxidants were generally similar. Mute swans showed the highest levels of heterophils, lysozymes and haemolysis among the three species, possibly due to its larger body mass. Our results point to a reduced investment in adaptive immune function in the invasive species as a possible resources-saving immunological strategy due to the loss of co-evolved parasites in the new colonised habitats, as observed in a previous study. A lower investment in immune function may benefit other energy-demanding activities, such as reproduction, dispersal, and territoriality.']",public,['-'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6034-7450', 'prefLabel': 'Messina, Simone'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1844-4481', 'prefLabel': 'Prüter, Hanna'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9488-0069', 'prefLabel': 'Czirják, Gábor Árpád'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8140-8790', 'prefLabel': 'Costantini, David'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Lower adaptive immunity in invasive Egyptian geese compared to sympatric native waterfowls'],2025-06-12T07:56:01.295+0200,336.0
frl:6511709,"['CONTEXT:\r\n\r\nPreserving functional connectivity is a conservation priority to secure the long-term viability of geographically dispersed subpopulations, such as the jaguar (Panthera onca) populations in Central America. However, managing connectivity in this region is limited due to the scarcity of local assessments of the connectivity between existing populations, some of which exhibit low levels of gene flow and genetic admixture.\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n\r\nWe selected the jaguar as a model species to understand how gene flow of large carnivores is shaped in a heavily human-impacted landscape in the Neotropics. We assessed the impact of landscape features and spatial scale on jaguar gene flow across northern Central America, predicted synoptic, landscape-wide functional connectivity across the region; and compared connectivity predictions based on models of gene flow, habitat suitability, and expert knowledge.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nWe employed genetic data based on 335 faecal samples collected from 72 individual jaguars. We parameterized gene flow resistance surfaces using linear mixed effects models and the maximum likelihood population-effects method. We evaluated nine landscape variables at six spatial scales, selecting the optimal scale and transformation for each variable according to univariate models and AIC. To predict jaguar gene flow, we developed multivariate models and implemented resistant kernels to forecast functional connectivity between jaguar populations across the study region under three dispersal distance scenarios. Furthermore, we compared the connectivity estimates based on gene flow against those based on habitat suitability and the corridors delineated by expert knowledge in the region.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nLow resistance to jaguar gene flow was associated with greater tree cover and vegetation, lower areas of built-up, and intermediate distances from water bodies. Notably, tree cover affected jaguar gene flow on a smaller scale compared to the rest of variables. Higher connectivity, indicated by lower resistance, was found within and around the largest jaguar conservation units (JCUs) such as the Reserva-de-Biosfera-Transfronteriza, Selva-Maya and Maya-Mountains. This contrasted with the smallest JCUs, like Sierra-Santa-Cruz and Sierra-de-las-Minas in eastern Guatemala, and Cordillera-Nombre-de-Dios in Honduras. Across the region, lower connectivity was observed in the Caribbean connection between eastern Guatemala and midwestern Honduras, as well as in the Honduran and Nicaraguan Miskito area. Models based on gene flow and habitat suitability were similar in their predictions of areas of high connectivity; however, the habitat suitability models predicted larger areas of low connectivity than did the gene flow models. Moreover, the expert knowledge corridors were consistent with areas of high and medium connectivity as predicted by the gene flow model.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nGene flow of jaguars is positively driven by the presence of forest and water sources, while human impact (built-up and non-vegetation areas) has a negative effect. Areas of lowest resistance largely correspond to the location of JCUs, which serve as crucial reservoirs of high-quality jaguar habitat within the region. While the largest JCU in the region displayed high connectivity, the low connectivity between the smallest JCUs (i.e. Sierra-Santa-Cruz, Sierra-de-las-Minas and Cordillera-Nombre-de-Dios) underscores the need for conservation attention in these areas. Conservation and management actions such as habitat loss-prevention/restoration and anthropogenic impact mitigation should be prioritized in the binational region of Guatemala-Honduras, a key connectivity bottleneck between the species’ northern and southern ranges. Similarly, attention is warranted in the Honduran-Nicaraguan Miskito area.']",public,['39(2):12'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8743-6795', 'prefLabel': 'Calderón, Ana Patricia '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuZGF2ZXJkZS1Hb256YWxleiwgUGF0cmljaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Landaverde-Gonzalez, Patricia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3VsdHNjaCwgQ2xhdWRpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wultsch, Claudia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Rm9zdGVyLCBSZWJlY2Nh', 'prefLabel': 'Foster, Rebecca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFybXNlbiwgQmFydA==', 'prefLabel': 'Harmsen, Bart'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmlndWVyb2EsIE9tYXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Figueroa, Omar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FyY2lhLUFubGV1LCBSb255', 'prefLabel': 'Garcia-Anleu, Rony'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FzdGHDsWVkYSwgRnJhbmtsaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Castañeda, Franklin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QW1hdG8sIEdlb3JnZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Amato, George'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JpbW0sIFZvbGtlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Grimm, Volker'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVyLVNjaGFkdCwgU3RlcGhhbmll', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVsbGVyLCBLYXRoZXJpbmUgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Zeller, Katherine A.'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Modelling jaguar gene flow in fragmented landscapes offers insights into functional population connectivity'],2025-06-12T07:19:32.011+0200,336.0

However, the success of creating or maintaining wildlife-inclusive future cities can be challenged by management actions that are solely based on ecological research, while overlooking research on human perspectives. Despite the growth of literature on human-wildlife interactions, which complements the breadth of urban ecology research, the overlap between these two research areas is still uncommon. In this study, we reviewed the literature of wild mammals in urban areas to identify patterns and gaps in the literature. We found 848 published journal articles, of which 480 articles focused on wildlife ecology, 269 articles focused on human dimensions and 99 articles had interdisciplinary combinations of both. Ecology-centered publications tended to be about habitat, rather than behavior, diet, health, reproduction and inter-species-relations, and literature on human dimensions was more evenly divided into management, perception, conflict and coexistence. Most ecology studies reported on specific taxonomic families, mainly canids and murids, but in human-dimension studies, “wildlife” was considered more as a general community of species. The most studied interdisciplinary combination of research themes was wildlife habitat and human-wildlife conflicts (n = 22), while only nine studies incorporated perception with ecological research. Even though studies on human dimensions of wildlife in cities are increasing, interdisciplinary research is lacking, which limits the knowledge on how to manage and shape urban areas to achieve coexistence of humans and wild mammals. For future cities to successfully become biophilic and support human-wildlife coexistence, we outlined five key elements for a research agenda: 1) Investigate urban mammal research through an interdisciplinary lens; 2) Explore ecological dynamics beyond habitat selection; 3) Conduct research for coexistence; 4) Disentangle what is “urban wildlife”; 5) Study a diverse array of urban wild mammals.']",public,['79:90-101'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3186-9644', 'prefLabel': 'Moesch, Simon'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6852-5095', 'prefLabel': 'Wellmann, Thilo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4065-5194', 'prefLabel': 'Haase, Dagmar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7769-0845', 'prefLabel': 'Bhardwaj, Manisha'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Mammal Mia: A review on how ecological and human dimension research on urban wild mammals can benefit future biophilic cities'],2025-06-12T07:35:48.950+0200,336.0

Yet spatial planning for this connectivity often overlooks the combined impacts of climate and land-cover change, particularly in tropical regions where habitat loss is a more immediate biodiversity threat.\r\nWe explore the need for connectivity between protected areas to mitigate the dual impacts of climate- and land-cover change on Borneo. Using habitat suitability models and combined climate and land-cover change forecasts, we develop connectivity models for present and future scenarios, identifying optimal connections between protected areas for 81 species. By considering restoration and opportunity economic costs, we also explore the cost-benefit trade-offs of implementing connectivity plans.\r\nConnectivity solutions varied among species, but often converged on the same connections between protected areas, with contemporary connections traversing 6 to 40 km and comprising 67 % forest cover, on average. By the 2080s there were fewer connections, and while many were shorter, they also comprised poorer quality habitat, reflecting reductions in forest cover and species distributions. As a result, the economic cost of creating corridors between protected areas was estimated to be 65 % higher in 2080 than in 2020.\r\nOur analysis highlights the urgent need to prioritize connectivity interventions early to maximize long-term benefits for multiple species facing climate-change disruption while minimizing costs. However, conservation planning in tropical regions is complex, given high rates of forest degradation and loss. Implementing our approach at finer spatial scales could help identify cost-effective areas to prioritize landscape connectivity, helping safeguard tropical biodiversity amid changing environmental conditions.']",public,['299:110838'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RydWViaWcsIE1hdHRoZXcgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Struebig, Matthew J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2VuemxlciwgTW9yaXR6', 'prefLabel': 'Wenzler, Moritz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UnVudGluZywgUmViZWNjYSBLLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Runting, Rebecca K.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGF3LCBFbGl6YWJldGg=', 'prefLabel': 'Law, Elizabeth'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVkaWhhcnRhLCBTdWdlbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Budiharta, Sugeng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2VhbWFuLCBEYXZpZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Seaman, David'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JhbWVyLVNjaGFkdCwgU3RlcGhhbmll', 'prefLabel': 'Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Connectivity conservation to mitigate climate and land-cover change impacts on Borneo'],2025-06-12T08:33:20.918+0200,336.0

Experiments have focused on elucidating reservoir competence, infection kinetics and specifically horizontal transmission, although, vertical transmission plays a key role in many viral enzootic cycles. Herein, we investigate the permissiveness of Angolan free-tailed bats (AFBs), known to harbour Bombali virus, to other filoviruses: Ebola, Marburg, Taï Forest and Reston viruses. We demonstrate that only the bats inoculated with EBOV show high and disseminated viral replication and infectious virus shedding, without clinical disease, while the other filoviruses fail to establish productive infections. Notably, we evidence placental-specific tissue tropism and a unique ability of EBOV to traverse the placenta, infect and persist in foetal tissues of AFBs, which results in distinct genetic signatures of adaptive evolution. These findings not only demonstrate plausible routes of horizontal and vertical transmission in these bats, which are expectant of reservoir hosts, but may also reveal an ancillary transmission mechanism, potentially required for the maintenance of EBOV in small reservoir populations.</jats:p>']",public,['15(1):925'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9775-0550', 'prefLabel': 'Riesle-Sbarbaro, Silke'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3456-1303', 'prefLabel': 'Wibbelt, Gudrun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RMO8eCwgQS4=', 'prefLabel': 'Düx, A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S291YWtvdSwgVi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Kouakou, V.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9rZWxtYW5uLCBNLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Bokelmann, M.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuc2VuLUthbnQsIEsu', 'prefLabel': 'Hansen-Kant, K.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lyY2hvZmYsIE4u', 'prefLabel': 'Kirchoff, N.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6474-9139', 'prefLabel': 'Laue, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3JvbWFyZWssIE4u', 'prefLabel': 'Kromarek, N.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuZGVyLCBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Lander, A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Vm9nZWwsIFUu', 'prefLabel': 'Vogel, U.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FobGJyaW5rLCBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wahlbrink, A.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6719-6931', 'prefLabel': 'Wozniak, David'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NvdHQsIEQuIFAu', 'prefLabel': 'Scott, D.

frl:6511932,"[""Endometriosis, though not classified as a carcinogenic condition, shares features such as oxidative stress, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammation with tumor cells. This study aims to review the effects of flavonoids on these processes and their molecular mechanisms in preventing and treating endometriosis. A comprehensive review was conducted, involving a literature search in online databases using keywords like “endometriosis,” “endometrioma,” and “flavonoid.” Two authors screened the literature based on predefined criteria, and the selected studies were summarized in a structured data extraction table. Studies reviewed showed that various flavonoids impact key processes in endometriosis, including angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and invasiveness. Flavonoids such as 2′,7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), naringenin, apigenin, myricetin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), chrysin, and 6,8-diprenylorobol were found to induce oxidative stress. Xanthohumol, isoliquiritigenin, and luteolin demonstrated effects on angiogenesis. Apigenin, isoliquiritigenin, and luteolin exhibited anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, 3,6-dihydroxyflavone, isoliquiritigenin, and naringenin displayed anti-invasive activities. Flavonoid–receptor interactions further enhance their therapeutic potential in endometriosis management. Flavonoids such as nobiletin, chrysin, and daidzein modulate PPARγ and PPARα, reducing inflammation, promoting apoptosis, and improving lipid metabolism. These interactions regulate critical pathways in angiogenesis and immune responses. Additionally, flavonoids impact the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), with compounds like resveratrol inhibiting cell proliferation and cholesterol biosynthesis, further suppressing lesion growth. The ability of flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol to antagonize NR4A1 leads to reduced cell proliferation and oxidative stress in endometriotic tissues. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms through which specific flavonoids modulate angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and invasiveness in endometriosis. By targeting receptors such as PPARs, AhR, and NR4A1, flavonoids demonstrate the capacity to modulate both metabolic and inflammatory pathways, offering a multifaceted approach to managing endometriosis. Flavonoids can selectively target pathophysiologic molecules and pathways implicated in the condition. Consequently, leveraging the therapeutic attributes of flavonoids could lead to novel strategies for managing endometriosis.""]",public,['13(1):e4607'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2213-497X', 'prefLabel': 'Goleij, Pouya'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbmRhbiwgTW9oYW5uYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Khandan, Mohanna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhemVlaSBUYWJhcmksIE1vaGFtbWFkIEFtaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Khazeei Tabari, Mohammad Amin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FuYXllLCBQYW50ZWEgTWFqbWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Sanaye, Pantea Majma'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxpamFuemFkZWgsIERvcnNh', 'prefLabel': 'Alijanzadeh, Dorsa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29sdGFuaSwgQWZzYW5laA==', 'prefLabel': 'Soltani, Afsaneh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG9zc2VpbmksIFphaHJh', 'prefLabel': 'Hosseini, Zahra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFyc2VuLCBEYW5hw6kgUy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Larsen, Danaé S.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2hhbiwgSGFyb29u', 'prefLabel': 'Khan, Haroon'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VtYXIsIEFsYW4gUHJlbQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kumar, Alan Prem'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4870-7713', 'prefLabel': 'Daglia, Maria'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Unlocking the Potential: How Flavonoids Affect Angiogenesis, Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Proliferation, Invasion, and Alter Receptor Interactions in Endometriosis']",2025-06-30T10:35:07.110+0200,286.0

frl:6524997,"['BACKGROUND:\r\nImmunotherapy dramatically increases patient survival and radically changes the way lung cancer is treated. Through intricate network analysis of disease-related symptoms, symptom networks are able to statistically analyze and depict the links between different symptoms. Through symptom network analysis, this study seeks to pinpoint the primary symptoms that immunotherapy-treated lung cancer survivors encounter. Furthermore, by leveraging the synergistic relationships between symptoms, it aims to investigate the target actions for precise interventions, offering important insights for the creation of a successful symptom management program.\r\nMETHODS: \r\nWe assessed the symptoms of 249 lung cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between February and October of 2024. The evaluation was conducted using the Lung Cancer-Specific Module and the Anderson Symptom Assessment Scale (Chinese version). Following the use of exploratory factor analysis to discover symptom clusters, we calculated the centrality indices and created a network structure using the R programming language that displayed the connections between the symptoms. After controlling for factors, we constructed contemporaneous networks that had all 17 symptoms.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nFour symptom clusters—respiratory, emotional, gastrointestinal, and neuro-perceptual—were shown to be generalized. The three most prevalent symptoms, as determined by nodal intensity, were sadness (rs\u2009=\u20097.43), cough (rs\u2009=\u20096.65) and nausea (rs\u2009=\u20096.73). The most common symptoms at bridge intensity were nausea (rs\u2009=\u20094.69), cough (rs\u2009=\u20094.72), and sadness (rs\u2009=\u20095.69). The network’s overall strength and structure did not significantly differ between the male and female groups, or between those who had or did not have a history of smoking.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThis study demonstrates that the symptom burden is significant among survivors of lung cancer immunotherapy, with sadness, cough, and nausea playing crucial roles in the multidimensional symptom network.

This study aimed to make a comparative evaluation in terms of the readability, information accuracy and quality of the answers given by artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini, which have become popular with the widespread access to medical information, to user questions about AS, a chronic inflammatory joint disease. In this study, the 25 most frequently queried keywords related to AS determined through Google Trends were directed to each 3 AI-based chatbots. The readability of the resulting responses was evaluated using readability indices such as Simple Gunning Fog (GFOG), Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG). The quality of the responses was measured by Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) and Global Quality Score (GQS) scores, and the reliability was measured using the modified DISCERN and Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) scales. According to Google Trends data, the most frequently searched keywords related to AS are “Ankylosing spondylitis pain”, “Ankylosing spondylitis symptoms” and “Ankylosing spondylitis disease”, respectively. It was found that the readability levels of the answers produced by AI-based chatbots were above the 6th grade level and showed a statistically significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In EQIP, JAMA, mDISCERN and GQS evaluations, Perplexity stood out in terms of information quality and reliability, receiving higher scores compared to other chat robots (p\u2009<\u20090.05). It has been found that the answers given by AI chatbots to AS-related questions exceed the recommended readability level and the reliability and quality assessment raises concerns due to some low scores.

In recent years, scientists have turned to natural compounds such as plant extracts as an alternative to address concerns related to biofilm-mediated disease transmission, increasing bacterial resistance, and the adverse impacts of antibiotics. Consequently, this study investigated the antimicrobial properties of ethanolic, hydroethanolic, and aqueous extracts of Teucrium polium L. (T. polium), which belongs to the Lamiaceae family, at different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500, 1000\u2009ppm) against seven bacteria commonly associated with dental decay. The hydroethanolic extract demonstrated the highest efficacy against S. mutans (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\u2009=\u20091.24\u2009mg/mL), while the ethanolic extract exhibited the most potent activity against S. sanguinis (MIC\u2009=\u20091.55\u2009mg/mL). For S. sobrinus, the ethanolic extract was the most effective (MIC\u2009=\u20091.52\u2009mg/mL), whereas the hydromethanolic extract displayed the highest efficacy against S. salivarius (MIC\u2009=\u20091.52\u2009mg/mL). S. aureus was most susceptible to the ethanolic extract (MIC\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009mg/mL), whereas the aqueous extract demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial effect against S. epidermidis (MIC\u2009=\u20092.03\u2009mg/mL). Finally, the ethanolic extract exhibited the maximum efficacy against L. fermentum (MIC\u2009=\u20091.36\u2009mg/mL). Overall, the ethanolic extract demonstrated the highest efficacy against all tested bacteria, followed by the hydroethanolic extract, while the aqueous extract showed comparatively lower effectiveness. Therefore, depending on the specific target bacteria, it is suggested to combine the antibacterial extract of T. polium with the most effective solvent to effectively combat the bacteria responsible for dental decay. The study found that mouthwashes containing ethanolic and hydroethanolic extracts, at a concentration of 2.44\u2009mg/L, effectively inhibited the growth of all oral bacteria contributing to dental caries. Future research should explore T. polium extracts' mechanisms of action against oral pathogens, their practical applications, and their efficacy against conventional treatments, paving the way for innovative dental therapies.""]",public,['13(1):e4718'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmF2YWRwb3VyLCBLYW1hbmQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Javadpour, Kamand'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hla2FyY2hpemFkZWgsIEhhamFy', 'prefLabel': 'Shekarchizadeh, Hajar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6933-635X', 'prefLabel': 'Goli, Mohammad'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yYWRpeWFuIFRlaHJhbmksIEhlbGVuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Moradiyan Tehrani, Helena'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Antimicrobial Efficacy of Teucrium polium L.

We use the coconut crab (Birgus latro) on Pemba, United Republic of Zanzibar as a case study for estimating highly fragmented populations and metapopulation sizes. The species is a very large terrestrial decapod threatened by exploitation and habitat alteration and now classified as vulnerable. We developed an integrated model to analyse capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from five sites jointly with count data from 24 sites to estimate site-level densities and population sizes, predicted total population size across the Pemba archipelago, and investigated the effect of six predictors of human influence on density. We fitted separate models to test the effect of the same predictors on raw counts and individual body mass. We estimate the total population of coconut crabs on the Pemba archipelago to be c. 6700 terrestrial individuals. We show that government protection generally affects crabs positively, whereas presence of agriculture negatively affects their densities. This study highlights that time-consuming CMR data can be leveraged to estimate densities on less visited sites, and that fully protected islands are critical for maintaining relatively high population densities.

The schools were divided into two groups: experimental and control, with a ratio of 1:2. Two types of molecular salivary tests for SARS-CoV-2 were used to conduct the screening. This study included 16 experimental schools and 32 control schools. Out of 2527 subjects, 11,475 swabs were administrated, with 9177 tests deemed valid for analysis (a 20% loss of tests). Among these, 89 subjects (3.5%) tested positive. In control schools, 1895 subjects (6.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This study recorded peaks in infections during the winter and autumn months, consistent with patterns observed in the general population. Beginning in September 2022, a shift occurred, with 2.6% of positive cases reported in the case schools compared to 0.3% in the control schools. Initially, most cases of COVID-19 were detected in the control schools; however, as the pandemic emergency phase concluded, cases were primarily identified through active screening in experimental schools.

Mitochondrial DNA maintenance-related gene (mtDNA MRG) variants contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer progression and are associated with cancer prognosis. However, the mechanism of mtDNA MRGs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. METHODS: Data for a total of 487 HCC samples were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The mitochondrial regulatory pathway gene set was downloaded, and 22 mtDNA MRGs were identified by screening. Based on these 22 genes, the HCC samples were grouped by unsupervised clustering based on a machine learning model. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct the mtDNA score model, and the relationships between the mtDNA score and clinicopathological features, tumor mutation burden (TMB), TME cell infiltration and biological processes were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of 22 mtDNA MRGs significantly different in HCC samples vs. normal controls. In this study, HCC samples were divided into three molecular subtypes based on the expression of mtDNA MRGs. The three subtypes exhibit different clinical characteristics and immune infiltration profiles, and the cell infiltration profiles corresponded to the immune rejection, immune inflammation, and immune-desert phenotypes, respectively. A total of 740 core genes were obtained from different molecular subtypes, and these genes were divided into three gene subtypes. The mtDNA score model, which can be used to assess tumor immune cell invasion, clinicopathological features, genetic variation, and prognosis, was subsequently constructed. A high mtDNA score was associated with a high mutation burden, high clinical stage and poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: mtDNA MRGs play important roles in HCC TMB, prognosis, clinicopathological features and the immune microenvironment. The mtDNA score can be used to evaluate HCC prognosis, TMB and the immune microenvironment, thereby providing guidance for treatment decision making and prognosis prediction in HCC patients.\r\n']",public,['20(6):e0325033'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9uZywgRmFu', 'prefLabel': 'Rong, Fan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbmcsIEJpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Cheng, Bin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBMaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Ling'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmVuZywgU2hhb2Jv', 'prefLabel': 'Zeng, Shaobo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIFh1bmxpYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Xunliang'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0401-535X', 'prefLabel': 'Meng, Zhongji'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Correlation analysis of mitochondrial DNA maintenance-related genes with HCC prognosis, tumor mutation burden and tumor microenvironment features']",2025-06-03T14:13:31.912+0200,337.0

frl:6511312,"['BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by the loss of pancreatic cells, resulting in total insulin insufficiency. According to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, T1DM treatment aims to achieve appropriate glycemic control and to prevent and avoid repeated episodes of hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy alone addresses the symptoms of the disease but fails to target the underlying pathophysiology of T1DM in children despite continuous efforts to enhance insulin regimens. Therefore, immunotherapy-based approaches have been considered potential treatments for T1DM in children since they can regulate the autoimmune responses and enhance the children’s quality of life by reducing their daily dose intake of insulin. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we have covered a few immunotherapeutic options based on preclinical and clinical data, namely, Teplizumab, Golimumab, Imatinib, Etanercept, Canakinumab, Ladarixin, Ala-Ala, Anakinra, and Otelixizumab in reliable databases such as Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference (SMD) were used to evaluate the outcomes with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: To assess the effect of immunotherapy on the patients’ daily dosage of insulin and their HbA1c and C-peptide levels, data from twelve trials were combined and synthesized. Because of the high levels of heterogeneity in the selected studies, a random-effects model was used for analysis. The combined data showed that patients receiving immunotherapy had higher C-peptide levels (Mean Difference (MD) = 1.51; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-2.56, 5.58]); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.42). On the other hand, patients in the immunotherapy group had significantly decreased HbA1c levels (MD = -0.63; 95% CI: [-1.18, -0.07]; p = 0.03), indicating that immunotherapy had a positive impact on glycemic management. Additionally, patients receiving immunotherapy exhibited a drop in their daily insulin dosage (MD = -1.15; 95% CI: [-2.59, 0.28]); however, this drop failed to achieve statistical significance (p = 0.10), thus indicating the need for additional research. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating T1DM by examining its effects on the patients’ required dose of insulin, C-peptide, and HbA1c levels. While some studies failed to show desired results, the overall effect was an increase in C-peptide levels and a decrease in HbA1c levels.

frl:6510927,"['BACKGROUND: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that impacts motor planning and control of the upper limbs (UL) and leads to cognitive impairments. Rehabilitation approaches, including motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO), along with the use of brain-machine interfaces (BMI), are essential in the PD population to enhance neuroplasticity and mitigate symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To provide a description of a rehabilitation protocol for evaluating the effects of isolated and combined applications of MI and action observation (AO), along with BMI, on upper limb (UL) motor changes and cognitive function in PD. METHODS: This study provides a detailed protocol for a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. After selection, participants will be randomly assigned to one of five experimental groups. Each participant will be assessed at three points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a follow-up four weeks after the intervention ends. The intervention consists of 10 sessions, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. EXPECTED RESULTS: The primary outcome expected is an improvement in the Test d’Évaluation des Membres Supérieurs de Personnes Âgées score, accompanied by a reduction in task execution time. Secondary outcomes include motor symptoms in the upper limbs, assessed via the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale - Part III and the 9-Hole Peg Test; cognitive function, assessed with the PD Cognitive Rating Scale; and occupational performance, assessed with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. DISCUSSION: This study protocol is notable for its intensive daily sessions. Both MI and AO are low-cost, enabling personalized interventions that physiotherapists and occupational therapists can readily replicate in practice. While BMI use does require professionals to acquire an exoskeleton, the protocol ensures the distinctiveness of the interventions and, to our knowledge, is the first to involve individuals with PD.\r\n']",public,['20(4):e0315148'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXN0aXZhbGV0LCBLw6F0aW5lIE1hcmNoZXphbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Estivalet, Kátine Marchezan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0dGVudXp6bywgVGF0aWFuYSBTYWxheWFyYW4gZGUgQWd1aWFy', 'prefLabel': 'Pettenuzzo, Tatiana Salayaran de Aguiar'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWF6emlsbGksIE5hdMOhbGlhIExvcGVz', 'prefLabel': 'Mazzilli, Natália Lopes'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9496-4884', 'prefLabel': 'Ferreira, Luis Fernando'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2VjaGV0dGksIEZlcm5hbmRh', 'prefLabel': 'Cechetti, Fernanda'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['The use of brain-machine interface, motor imagery, and action observation in the rehabilitation of individuals with Parkinson’s disease: A protocol study for a randomized clinical trial']",2025-04-08T14:28:27.278+0200,337.0

METHODS: Patients from the Ontario Best Practices Research Initiative (OBRI) a clinical cohort (2008–2020) were linked to the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), a population health database. Each HZ patient was matched to four non-HZ patients based on sex, age, and HZ diagnosis date. The incidence of primary (HCU including hospitalization, Emergency Department (ED) visits, physician visits) and secondary (mortality and chronic clinical conditions) outcomes was calculated for each cohort, along with the impact of disease activity, patient-reported outcomes, and RA medication on these outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 269 RA patients with and 1072 without HZ. At index date (HZ diagnosis) patients with HZ were less likely to have private health insurance (45.7% vs. 56.5%) and more prone to use biologics (30.9% vs. 26.8%) and JAK inhibitors (3.7% vs. 2.6%). Hospitalization/ED visits and mortality were higher in HZ patients, but these differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for other factors. HZ patients had significantly more physician visits (adj IRR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03–1.33). Female sex and lower CDAI were associated with fewer physician visits.

Group 1 served as the control group, receiving corn oil. Group 2 received LSO (3\u2009g/kg body weight orally) for 28 days. Rats in Group 3 (FU-exposed group) received an oral administration of FU at a dosage of 16\u2009mg/kg body weight each day for 28 days. Rats in Group 4 (Therapeutic co-treated group) were administered both LSO and subsequent FU exposure according to the previously outlined dosage regimen for 28 days. Rats in Group 5 (Protective co-treated group) received LSO seed oil for 14 days as protection then received Fu at the same mentioned doses of Fu until the end of experiment. Rats administered FU and/or LSO gained noticeably more weight than the control group. LSO significantly decreased AST and LDH levels in both the protection and treatment groups as compared to the FU-only group. It also assisted in restoring testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels that were decreased by FU, especially in the protected group. LSO also reduced kidney damage markers and normalized biomarker levels when administered with FU. The LSO-only group demonstrated normal immune response markers, similar to the control group. By changing MDA levels and increasing SOD, GSH, and TAC levels, co-treatment with LSO enhanced liver health. The control and LSO groups displayed normal spleen structure, whereas the LSO/FU group had normal seminiferous tubules with mild edema and congestion.

frl:6510869,"['Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a rare febrile illness affecting infants and young children, potentially leading to coronary artery complications and, in severe cases, mortality if untreated. However, KD is frequently misdiagnosed as a common fever in clinical settings, and the inherent data imbalance further complicates accurate prediction when using traditional machine learning and statistical methods. This paper introduces two advanced approaches to address these challenges, enhancing prediction accuracy and generalizability. The first approach proposes a stacking model termed the Disease Classifier (DC), specifically designed to recognize minority class samples within imbalanced datasets, thereby mitigating the bias commonly observed in traditional models toward the majority class. Secondly, we introduce a combined model, the Disease Classifier with CTGAN (CTGAN-DC), which integrates DC with Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) technology to improve data balance and predictive performance further. Utilizing CTGAN-based oversampling techniques, this model retains the original data characteristics of KD while expanding data diversity. This effectively balances positive and negative KD samples, significantly reducing model bias toward the majority class and enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalizability. Experimental evaluations indicate substantial performance gains, with the DC and CTGAN-DC models achieving notably higher predictive accuracy than individual machine learning models. Specifically, the DC model achieves sensitivity and specificity rates of 95%, while the CTGAN-DC model achieves 95% sensitivity and 97% specificity, demonstrating superior recognition capability. Furthermore, both models exhibit strong generalizability across diverse KD datasets, particularly the CTGAN-DC model, which surpasses the JAMA model with a 3% increase in sensitivity and a 95% improvement in generalization sensitivity and specificity, effectively resolving the model collapse issue observed in the JAMA model. In sum, the proposed DC and CTGAN-DC architectures demonstrate robust generalizability across multiple KD datasets from various healthcare institutions and significantly outperform other models, including XGBoost. These findings lay a solid foundation for advancing disease prediction in the context of imbalanced medical data.']",public,['19(12):e0314995'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-6290-0967', 'prefLabel': 'Hung, Chuan-Sheng'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0840-394X', 'prefLabel': 'Lin, Chun-Hung Richard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBKYWluLVNoaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Jain-Shing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgU2hpLUh1YW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Shi-Huang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVuZywgVHN1bmctQ2hp', 'prefLabel': 'Hung, Tsung-Chi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VHNhaSwgQ2hpaC1NaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Tsai, Chih-Min'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Enhancing generalization in a Kawasaki Disease prediction model using data augmentation: Cross-validation of patients from two major hospitals in Taiwan'],2025-04-03T13:38:13.678+0200,337.0

AIM: To assist policy making and lead further research by describing the current status of gynecological health and Pap test results in wwMS. METHODS: Cross-sectional study on wwMS living in Isfahan, Iran. Participants were surveyed and referred for a Pap test, results of which were compared with 1:2 age- and socioeconomic status-matched healthy controls (HC). Primary outcome was the degree of non-benign squamous/glandular cell abnormalities. Secondary outcomes were presence of evidence of infection, and the degree of benign inflammatory/reactive changes. Logistic regression models were utilized for analyses. RESULTS: 197 wwMS were included (mean age [SD], 41.2 [8.3]; median EDSS (IQR) 1.5 [0.5]). 74.1% reported having sexual activity more than once per week in the past year. For contraception, 21.6% and 16.8% used calendar-based methods and male condoms, respectively. 7% had contracted a gynecological infection in the past. Only 1% had received HPV vaccination. Compared to HC, benign reactive/inflammatory changes in Pap tests were less frequently seen in the wwMS (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.4; p <\u2009 0.001), while evidence of infection was seen more frequently (OR: 11.5, 95% CI: 3.3, 40; p <\u2009 0.001).

Adherence to chemotherapy is particularly complex and multifaceted, and it can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the therapy. In Ethiopia, non-adherence to chemotherapy is on the rise, but there has been limited research specifically on adherence to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses IV chemotherapy adherence and associated factors among cancer patients in the Sidama Region, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study included a purposive sample of 413 cancer patients undergoing IV chemotherapy. The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used to measure adherence levels. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 26, employing descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, mean, median, and standard deviation to describe the characteristics and magnitude of IV chemotherapy adherence. Bivariable and multivariable logistical regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with IV chemotherapy adherence. RESULT: The current study revealed that the overall magnitude of good adherence toward chemotherapy treatment among cancer patients was 176/413(42.6%), with a 95% CI of 38–47.9. The multivariable analysis identified several independent factors associated with IV chemotherapy adherence. These factors included being married (AOR\u2009=\u20093.2, 95% CI:1.3,8), employment as a government employee (AOR\u2009=\u20092.4,95% CI:1.3,4.5), availability of transportation (AOR\u2009=\u20095.5, 95% CI:2.1,14), Good social support (AOR\u2009=\u20092.1,95% CI:1.9,11.3) and having a curative goal of treatment (AOR\u2009=\u20091.7,95% CI:1.1,2.7).

We described initial treatment patterns after diagnosis and survival, stratified among others by age. RESULTS: We included 42,629 incident lung cancer patients (58% male). Surgery within three months after diagnosis was performed in 36%, 31%, 29% and 18% of patients aged\u2009<\u200950, 50–69, 70–79 and\u2009≥\u200980, respectively. Among patients without surgery, systemic therapy was administered in 77%, 72%, 54% and 25% of patients aged\u2009<\u200950, 50–69, 70–79 and\u2009≥\u200980, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies were administered in 15–30% of patients across age groups, and 4% to 15% received protein kinase inhibitors. Overall, 21% of patients remained untreated. In the age groups\u2009<\u200950, 50–69, 70–79 and\u2009≥\u200980, this proportions was 9%, 12%, 22% and 48%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the therapy of lung cancer patients in Germany and quantitatively demonstrates the considerable differences between age groups.

frl:6510871,"['BACKGROUND: N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: 3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis. RESULTS: Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n']",public,['19(12):e0313012'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THYsIFRhaWhvbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Lv, Taihong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXUsIEhhbm1pbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Yu, Hanming'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmksIFppc2h1bw==', 'prefLabel': 'Ji, Zishuo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgWXVydQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Yuru'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbywgUWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhao, Qi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9551-8177', 'prefLabel': 'ma, Li'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Association of N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) with arthritis among adult participants']",2025-04-03T13:50:31.891+0200,337.0

frl:6511242,"[""Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation is seen in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease onwards and has been associated with symptoms of agitation. It is hypothesized that compensatory locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system overactivity and impaired emotion regulation could underlie agitation propensity, but to our knowledge this has not previously been investigated. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of agitation would help the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Using a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and probable mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) study cohort (N = 309, aged 67-96 years, 51% female), we assessed cross-sectional relationships between a latent factor representing the functional integrity of an affect-related executive regulation network and agitation point prevalence and severity scores. In a subsample of individuals with locus coeruleus MRI imaging data (N = 37, aged 68-93 years, 49% female), we also investigated preliminary associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios (a measure of structural integrity, whole or divided into rostral, middle, and caudal thirds) and individual affect-related regulation network factor scores and agitation measures. Regression models controlled for effects of age and clinical disease severity and, for models including resting-state functional MRI connectivity variables, grey matter volume and education years. Agitation point prevalence showed a positive relationship with a latent factor representing the functional integrity (and a negative relationship with a corresponding structural measure) of the affect-related executive regulation network. Locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios were positively associated with agitation severity (but only for the rostral third, in N = 13) and negatively associated with the functional affect-related executive regulation latent factor scores. Resting-state functional connectivity between a medial prefrontal cortex region and the left amygdala was related to locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios. These findings implicate the involvement of locus coeruleus integrity and emotion dysregulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease and support the presence of potential compensatory processes. At the neural level, there may be a dissociation between mechanisms underlying agitation risk per se and symptom severity. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, incorporating longitudinal designs, measures of autonomic function and non-linear modelling approaches to explore potential causal and context-dependent relationships across Alzheimer's disease stages.""]",public,['7(1):fcae457'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7482-2758', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Kathy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmV0dHMsIE1hdHRoZXcgSi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Betts, Matthew J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SMOkbW1lcmVyLCBEb3JvdGhlYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hämmerer, Dorothea'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0139-5388', 'prefLabel': 'Duzel, Emrah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4331-6112', 'prefLabel': 'Mather, Mara'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9pc2VyLCBKb25hdGhhbiBQLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Roiser, Jonathan P.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobmVpZGVyLCBBbmph', 'prefLabel': 'Schneider, Anja'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BvdHRrZSwgQW5uaWth', 'prefLabel': 'Spottke, Annika'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9zdGFtemFkZWgsIEF5ZGE=', 'prefLabel': 'Rostamzadeh, Ayda'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8237-4481', 'prefLabel': 'Schott, Björn'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF1Y2htYW5uLCBCb3Jpcy1TdGVwaGFu', 'prefLabel': 'Rauchmann, Boris-Stephan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFza2UsIENocmlzdG9waA==', 'prefLabel': 'Laske, Christoph'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmFub3dpdHosIERhbmllbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Janowitz, Daniel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3BydXRoLCBFaWtlIEou', 'prefLabel': 'Spruth, Eike J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXJzw7Z6bMO8LCBFcnNpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ersözlü, Ersin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TMO8c2VicmluaywgRmFsaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Lüsebrink, Falk'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmVzc2VuLCBGcmFuaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Jessen, Frank'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJvbW1hbm4sIEluZ28=', 'prefLabel': 'Frommann, Ingo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lsaW1hbm4sIEluZ28=', 'prefLabel': 'Kilimann, Ingo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2lsdGZhbmcsIEplbnM=', 'prefLabel': 'Wiltfang, Jens'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnJ1c3RrZXJuLCBKb2hhbm5h', 'prefLabel': 'Brustkern, Johanna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJpbGxlciwgSm9zZWY=', 'prefLabel': 'Priller, Josef'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVsbG1hbi1SZWdlbiwgSnVsaWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Hellman-Regen, Julian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnVlcmdlciwgS2F0aGFyaW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Buerger, Katharina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmxpZXNzYmFjaCwgS2xhdXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Fliessbach, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoZWZmbGVyLCBLbGF1cw==', 'prefLabel': 'Scheffler, Klaus'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2xlaW5laWRhbSwgTHVjYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kleineidam, Luca'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RhcmssIE1lbGluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Stark, Melina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5231-1714', 'prefLabel': 'Ewers, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FnbmVyLCBNaWNoYWVs', 'prefLabel': 'Wagner, Michael'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGV0ZXJzLCBPbGl2ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Peters, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVjaGVudCwgUGV0ZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Dechent, Peter'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGVybmVjemt5LCBSb2JlcnQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Perneczky, Robert'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U29kZW5rYW1wLCBTZWJhc3RpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sodenkamp, Sebastian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGV0emVyLCBTdGVmYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Hetzer, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3586-3194', 'prefLabel': 'Teipel, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhbnosIFdlbnplbA==', 'prefLabel': 'Glanz, Wenzel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SG93YXJkLCBSb2JlcnQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Howard, Robert'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","[""Locus coeruleus signal intensity and emotion regulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease""]",2025-05-09T09:59:03.372+0200,242.0

Here, we tested the hypothesis that PMCA-Neuroplastin complexes exist in specific ganglioside-containing rafts, which could affect calcium homeostasis. We analyzed the abundance of all four PMCA paralogs (PMCA1-4) and Neuroplastin isoforms (Np65 and Np55) in lipid rafts and bulk membrane fractions from GM2/GD2 synthase-deficient mouse brains. In these fractions, we found altered distribution of Np65/Np55 and selected PMCA isoforms, namely PMCA1 and 2. Cell surface staining and confocal microscopy identified GM1 as the main complex ganglioside co-localizing with Neuroplastin in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, blocking GM1 with a specific antibody resulted in delayed calcium restoration of electrically evoked calcium transients in the soma of hippocampal neurons. The content and composition of all ganglioside species were unchanged in Neuroplastin-deficient mouse brains. Therefore, we conclude that altered composition or disorganization of ganglioside-containing rafts results in changed regulation of calcium signals in neurons. We propose that GM1 could be a key sphingolipid for ensuring proper location of the PMCA-Neuroplastin complexes into rafts in order to participate in the regulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis.

Increasing evidence highlights the role of Neurocan (Ncan), a brain-specific component of ECM, in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Ncan localizes at PNNs, perisynaptically, and at the nodes of Ranvier and the AIS, highlighting its potential role in regulating axonal excitability. Here, we used knockdown and knockout approaches in mouse primary cortical neurons in combination with immunocytochemistry, Western blotting and electrophysiological techniques to characterize the role of Ncan in the organization of PNNs and AISs and regulation of neuronal activity. We found that reduced Ncan levels led to remodeling of PNNs around neurons via upregulation of aggrecan mRNA and protein levels, increased expression of activity-dependent c-Fos and FosB genes and elevated spontaneous synaptic activity.

This work performed the in vitro experiments and animal assay to explore whether oleanolic acid alleviates lipid accumulation induced by high-fat diet by mediating PPARγ. Oil red O staining showed that oleanolic acid can reduce lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, which were treated with oleic acid and palmitic acid. Immunofluorescence, western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR showed that oleanolic acid could promote nuclear translocation of PPARγ and reduce the expression level of PPARγ, C/EBP-β, and SREBP-1c. The results of in vivo experiments indicated that dietary intervention with oleanolic acid can effectively improve the fat accumulation in liver tissue and attenuate the level of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum caused by high-fat diet. Meanwhile, oleanolic acid did not cause lesions in vital organs at the experimental concentrations. In addition, the computer simulation indicated that oleanolic acid could directly bind to PPARγ with a reasonable and stable docking conformation. The above research results can provide new evidence for oleanolic acid to prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.']",public,['12(10):8243-8254'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEd1YW5namll', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Guangjie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEh1aXlpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Huiying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9uZywgUnVpeWk=', 'prefLabel': 'Dong, Ruiyi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbywgSG9uZ21laQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhao, Hongmei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIEp1bmZlbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Junfeng'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WXVlLCBXZWltaW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Yue, Weiming'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-6314-9899', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Zheng'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Oleanolic acid attenuates obesity through modulating the lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice'],2025-03-25T10:59:38.917+0100,286.0

Our objective was to demonstrate changes in the microbiota and the relationships between nutrients in children with celiac disease (CD) who followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). A group of 11 children who were recently diagnosed with CD, ranging in age from 3 to 12, were monitored for a period of 6\u2009months. GFD is designed based on the individual's specific energy and nutrient needs, with strict control over dietary adherence. Food consumption, blood, and fecal samples were taken. Fecal samples were put through 16s rRNA sequencing. Microbial modifications were demonstrated using alpha diversity, beta diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NDMS), t-test, and metastats. Mean age was 6.4\u2009±\u20092.66\u2009years and 54.5% were male participants. Serological parameters were negative after 6\u2009months. Both unweighted (p\u2009=\u2009.019) and weighted (p\u2009=\u2009.021) Unifrac distances were higher before GFD, and differences were reliable according to NDMS analysis (stress\u2009=\u20090.189). The abundance of Bacteroides ovatus was increased (p\u2009=\u2009.014), whereas unidentified Lachnospiraceae, Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium Peptostreptococcus, and Dielma were decreased after GFD (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Associations between nutrients and several genera and species were identified. The presence of genus Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was inversely associated with fat intake after GFD (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Microbiota changes became evident over a period of 6\u2009months. The presence or absence of small bacteria may play a role in the development of CD.

This study aimed to assess quercetin's protective effects against fructose-induced mouse hepatic steatosis. Thirty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly allocated into four groups: control, high fructose diet (HFrD), HFrD supplemented with low-dose quercetin (HFrD+LQ), and HFrD supplemented with high-dose quercetin (HFrD+HQ). Biochemical, pathological, immune, and metabolic parameters were assessed. Quercetin treatment significantly reduced liver fat percentages in mice on a high fructose diet, with the most notable reduction observed in the HFrD+HQ group. Histological examination confirmed this reduction, revealing diminished lipid droplets and decreased inflammation and steatosis in hepatocytes. Compared to the high fructose group, interleukin-1 β and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly decreased, serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were markedly reduced, and blood high-density lipoprotein concentrations were substantially elevated after quercetin intervention (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Total bilirubin and triglyceride levels, which were significantly altered following high fructose intervention and reversed after quercetin intervention. Following the administration of 100\u2009mg/kg quercetin, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly reduced compared to the high fructose group. At the genus level, Erysipelotrichaceae_uncultured, Faecalibaculum, Odoribacter, and Allobaculum were significantly decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05), Lacnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella significantly increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, the 50\u2009mg/kg quercetin treatment only decreased the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae_uncultured (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, quercetin significantly enhanced the content of propionic acid and total acid (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the intestinal flora showed a significant correlation with the hepatic health-related phenotype in mice. Both 50 and 100\u2009mg/kg quercetin treatments significantly mitigated liver fat deposition in mice with fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. However, the higher dose of quercetin (100\u2009mg/kg) demonstrated a more pronounced effect in reducing liver inflammation, likely due to its impact on gut microbiota regulation.

However, autoantibodies against AT1A3 have not previously been reported in patients with subjective cognitive decline.\r\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 57-year-old female who underwent neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18 F fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Neural autoantibodies were assessed in serum and CSF. We found a normal cognitive profile together with a self-reported cognitive decline, and such consistent with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed anti-ATP1A3 autoantibodies. ATP1A3 autoantibodies were also detected in serum. Analysis of amyloid pathology markers in the CSF showed a slightly reduced amyloid β1-42/ amyloid β1-40 ratio. In view of the possible paraneoplastic autoantibodies, whole-body FDG-PET was performed, which did not reveal a malignancy-specific lesion. FDG-PET of the brain also showed no hypometabolism. We diagnosed SCD based on CSF-affirmed possible Alzheimer´s pathologic change with ATP1A3 autoantibodies in CSF and serum. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of CSF and serum ATP1A3 autoantibodies associated with SCD although an incidental finding cannot be fully excluded.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on fermented dairy products. Seventy-nine random samples were selected, and the salt (NaCl %) content was determined by potentiometric titration after sample preparation and homogenization; also samples were analyzed for their moisture (oven drying method). Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and one-sample t-test. A comprehensive literature review on salt reduction strategies was also performed proposing a model for an optimized low-salt fermented dairy product. This study found high salt content in many fermented dairy products. Brined cheese had the highest salt level (7.57\u2009g/100\u2009g), while pizza processed cheese had the lowest (1.03\u2009g/100\u2009g). Probiotic yogurts contained less salt (0.29\u2009g/100\u2009g) than regular ones. Other products like doogh (1.04\u2009g/100\u2009g), kefir (0.63\u2009g/100\u2009g), and kashk (2.78\u2009g/100\u2009g) also contributed significantly to salt intake. Most products exceeded recommended salt limits. Consuming just one serving of these products often accounted for a substantial portion of the daily recommended salt intake (WHO: 5\u2009g/day). This research emphasizes the need for reducing salt in fermented dairy products to improve public health. This study highlights the excessive salt content in many fermented dairy products, surpassing recommended daily intake levels. Therefore, to address this public health concern, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. For this purpose, Policymakers should implement stringent monitoring, enforce food labeling, and develop legislation to reduce salt content.

RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation plays a crucial role in oxidative stress and premature cellular senescence processes and is closely associated with age-related disorders. However, the anti-premature senescence via RNA m6A methylation mechanism of resveratrol is still not fully understood. In this study, based on premature senescence model of human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEFs) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a widely accepted model of premature senescence caused by oxidative stress, we explored the anti-aging regulatory effects of resveratrol at the RNA m6A methylation level. Our data suggested that resveratrol significantly delayed premature senescence by increasing cell viability, reducing SA-β-gal blue staining rate, ROS levels, and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) expression in HEFs. Meanwhile, resveratrol increased the whole RNA methyltransferases activity and the overall m6A level during senescence. Furthermore, three genes CCND2, E2F1, and GADD45B have been identified as the main ones regulating premature by resveratrol. Specifically, it decreased E2F1, GADD45B RNA m6A methylation level, and increased CCND2 level in premature cells. Our study provided new clues for exploring the mechanism and application of resveratrol in the field of premature aging.']",public,['12(11):9238-9251'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFhpbnl1', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Xinyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmh1LCBDaGVueXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Chenyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEx1eXVu', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Luyun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VGFuLCBMdXlp', 'prefLabel': 'Tan, Luyi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbmcsIFdlbmxp', 'prefLabel': 'Cheng, Wenli'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIE1pbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Min'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFhpbmd0YW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Xingtan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2922-0640', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Wenjuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFdlbmpp', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Wenji'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['RNA m6A methylation regulatory mechanism of resveratrol in premature senescence cells'],2025-04-17T11:26:00.151+0200,286.0
frl:6525010,"[""Random survival forests (RSF) can be applied to many time-to-event research questions and are particularly useful in situations where the relationship between the independent variables and the event of interest is rather complex. However, in many clinical settings, the occurrence of the event of interest is affected by competing events, which means that a patient can experience an outcome other than the event of interest. Neglecting the competing event (i.e., regarding competing events as censoring) will typically result in biased estimates of the cumulative incidence function (CIF). A popular approach for competing events is Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard model, which directly estimates the CIF by fitting a single-event model defined on a subdistribution timescale. Here, we integrate concepts from the subdistribution hazard modeling approach into the RSF. We develop several imputation strategies that use weights as in a discrete-time subdistribution hazard model to impute censoring times in cases where a competing event is observed. Our simulations show that the CIF is well estimated if the imputation already takes place outside the forest on the overall dataset. Especially in settings with a low rate of the event of interest or a high censoring rate, competing events must not be neglected, that is, treated as censoring. When applied to a real-world epidemiological dataset on chronic kidney disease, the imputation approach resulted in highly plausible predictor–response relationships and CIF estimates of renal events.""]",public,['66(6):e202400014'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9310-3804', 'prefLabel': 'Behning, Charlotte'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmlnZXJsLCBBbGV4YW5kZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Bigerl, Alexander'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8542-6291', 'prefLabel': 'Wright, Marvin N.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2VrdWxhLCBQZWdneQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Sekula, Peggy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVyZ2VyLCBNb3JpdHo=', 'prefLabel': 'Berger, Moritz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobWlkLCBNYXR0aGlhcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Schmid, Matthias'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Random survival forests with competing events: A subdistribution-based imputation approach'],2025-07-11T14:16:35.136+0200,266.0

In Arabidopsis thaliana, WHIRLY1 has been studied at the later stages of plant development, including flowering and leaf senescence, as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study, WHIRLY1 knockout mutants of A. thaliana were prepared by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to investigate the role of WHIRLY1 during early seedling development. The loss-of-function of WHIRLY1 in 5-day-old seedlings did not cause differences in the phenotype and the photosynthetic performance of the emerging cotyledons compared with the wild type. Nevertheless, comparative RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the knockout of WHIRLY1 affected the expression of a small but specific set of genes during this critical phase of development. About 110 genes were found to be significantly deregulated in the knockout mutant, wherein several genes involved in the early steps of aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL) biosynthesis were suppressed compared with wild-type plants. The downregulation of these genes in WHIRLY1 knockout lines led to decreased GSL contents in seedlings and in seeds. Since GSL catabolism mediated by myrosinases was not altered during seed-to-seedling transition, the results suggest that AtWHIRLY1 plays a major role in modulation of aliphatic GSL biosynthesis during early seedling development. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed a coincidence between the evolution of methionine-derived aliphatic GSLs and the addition of a new WHIRLY in core families of the plant order Brassicales.']",public,['121(1):e17181'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-3330', 'prefLabel': 'Nguyen, Thuy Linh'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW91dGVzaWRpLCBQaW5lbG9waSA=', 'prefLabel': 'Moutesidi, Pinelopi '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmllZ2xlciwgSsO2cmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Ziegler, Jörg'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhc25lY2ssIEFuaWtl', 'prefLabel': 'Glasneck, Anike'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7781-1085', 'prefLabel': 'Khosravi, Solmaz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWJlbCwgU3RlZmZlbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Abel, Steffen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5539-3097', 'prefLabel': 'Hensel, Götz'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6312-1761', 'prefLabel': 'Krupinska, Karin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVtYmVjaywgS2xhdXMg', 'prefLabel': 'Humbeck, Klaus '}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['WHIRLY1 regulates aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in early seedling development of Arabidopsis'],2025-04-10T11:49:15.625+0200,325.0

The modification methods sought to improve the hydrophobic nature of lysozyme’s surface, create oligomeric and peptide forms, and decrease immunogenicity. Findings showed that raising pepsin concentration enhanced the creation of peptide fractions, increasing surface hydrophobicity while reducing hydrolytic and antioxidant activities. Increased hydrophobicity and reduced enzyme activity were linked to enhanced antibacterial effectiveness, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, a characteristic absent in natural lysozyme. Additionally, the research noted a decrease in immunoreactivity as pepsin concentrations increased, achieving the lowest antibody response in optimized formulations.

To assess how the medium-to-large bodied terrestrial vertebrate community varied across these two main gradients of anthropogenic impact, we conducted a camera-trap survey across three production forest reserves in central Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, each with different past and current logging regimes. We analyzed data from a 32-species community using a Bayesian community occupancy model, investigating the response of occurrence, diversity, and composition to forest degradation and accessibility (a proxy for hunting pressure). We found forest degradation to be a strong driver of occurrence of individual species. Such responses led to declines in diversity and shifts in community composition, where forest-dependent species decreased while disturbance-tolerant species increased in occupancy probability with increasing forest degradation. Accessibility had a weaker effect on community diversity and species occupancy, and low-level hunting pressure and management of access to our study sites likely played an important role in mitigating accessibility effects. Nonetheless, our results showed accessibility had compounding effects on a wildlife community already affected negatively by forest degradation. Despite the impacts of forest degradation and accessibility on the terrestrial vertebrate community, our results highlight how the application of more sustainable practices—reducing forest disturbance and managing unauthorized access to logging roads—resulted in more intact wildlife communities.

We expect that our approach will be inspirational for similar assessments on rewilding initiatives globally.']",public,['6(12):e13221'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3042-1960', 'prefLabel': 'Nores-Quesada, Carlos Ignacio'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9606-4548', 'prefLabel': 'Álvarez Lao, Diego Jaime'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9396-0339', 'prefLabel': 'Navarro, Alberto'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7513-5418', 'prefLabel': 'Pérez Barbería, Francisco Javier'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0795-8962', 'prefLabel': 'Castaños, Pedro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FzdGHDsW9zIGRlIGxhIEZ1ZW50ZSwgSm9uZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Castaños de la Fuente, Jone'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9933-6836', 'prefLabel': 'Morales Muñiz, Arturo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9538-7110', 'prefLabel': 'AZORIT, CONCEPCIÓN'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2911-3629', 'prefLabel': 'Muñoz-Cobo Rosales, Joaquín María'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1359-435X', 'prefLabel': 'Fernández-Delgado, Carlos'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3322-4276', 'prefLabel': 'Granado Lorencio, Carlos Antonio'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6630-6956', 'prefLabel': 'Palmqvist, Paul'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9165-7766', 'prefLabel': 'Casimiro-Soriguer, Ramon'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3569-567X', 'prefLabel': 'Delibes, Miguel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3171-8261', 'prefLabel': 'Vilà Planella, Montserrat'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2915-4084', 'prefLabel': 'Simon, Miguel'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9545-8342', 'prefLabel': 'Cabezudo Artero, Baltasar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6849-1219', 'prefLabel': 'Galán, Carmen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8412-741X', 'prefLabel': 'García-Berthou, Emili'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1465-3857', 'prefLabel': 'Almodóvar, Ana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6127-5302', 'prefLabel': 'Elvira, Benigno'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0407-4053', 'prefLabel': 'Brufao Curiel, Pedro'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1059-1556', 'prefLabel': 'Casinos, Adria'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8273-3141', 'prefLabel': 'Herrero, Juan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8542-7809', 'prefLabel': 'Blanco, Juan Carlos'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5625-8690', 'prefLabel': 'García-González, Ricardo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4060-0153', 'prefLabel': 'Nogués-Bravo, David'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0576-3993', 'prefLabel': 'Margalida, Antoni'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6560-9093', 'prefLabel': 'Fisher, Brendan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6360-5339', 'prefLabel': 'Arlettaz, Raphaël'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9704-0946', 'prefLabel': 'Gordon, Iain'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7249-9953', 'prefLabel': 'Ludwig, Arne'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-3104', 'prefLabel': 'Lovari, Sandro'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7430-1824', 'prefLabel': 'Cooke, Brian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0368-7173', 'prefLabel': 'Carranza, Juan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7757-7156', 'prefLabel': 'Csányi, Sándor'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8953-9138', 'prefLabel': 'APOLLONIO, Marco'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7264-2158', 'prefLabel': 'Kowalczyk, Rafał'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGVtYXJhaXMsIFN0ZXZl', 'prefLabel': 'Demarais, Steve'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9213-998X', 'prefLabel': 'López-Bao, José Vicente'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Rewilding through inappropriate species introduction: The case of European bison in Spain'],2025-06-12T07:37:52.870+0200,336.0
frl:6511829,"['Horses revolutionized human history with fast mobility1. However, the timeline between their domestication and their widespread integration as a means of transport remains contentious2,3,4. Here we assemble a collection of 475 ancient horse genomes to assess the period when these animals were first reshaped by human agency in Eurasia. We find that reproductive control of the modern domestic lineage emerged around 2200 bce, through close-kin mating and shortened generation times. Reproductive control emerged following a severe domestication bottleneck starting no earlier than approximately 2700 bce, and coincided with a sudden expansion across Eurasia that ultimately resulted in the replacement of nearly every local horse lineage. This expansion marked the rise of widespread horse-based mobility in human history, which refutes the commonly held narrative of large horse herds accompanying the massive migration of steppe peoples across Europe around 3000 bce and earlier3,5. Finally, we detect significantly shortened generation times at Botai around 3500 bce, a settlement from central Asia associated with corrals and a subsistence economy centred on horses6,7. This supports local horse husbandry before the rise of modern domestic bloodlines.']",public,['631(8022):819-825'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5974-2189', 'prefLabel': 'Librado, Pablo'},

The links between mammalian host genetics, bacterial gut community, and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) content must be better understood in natural populations inhabiting heterogeneous environments. Hybridization, the interbreeding of genetically divergent populations, influences different components of the gut microbial communities. However, its impact on bacterial traits such as antibiotic resistance is unknown. Here, we present that hybridization might shape bacterial communities and ARG occurrence. We used amplicon sequencing to study the gut microbiome and to predict ARG composition in natural populations of house mice (Mus musculus). We compared gastrointestinal bacterial and ARG diversity, composition, and abundance across a gradient of pure and hybrid genotypes in the European House Mouse Hybrid Zone. We observed an increased overall predicted richness of ARG in hybrid mice. We found bacteria–ARG interactions by their co-abundance and detected phenotypes of extreme abundances in hybrid mice at the level of specific bacterial taxa and ARGs, mainly multidrug resistance genes.

This pilot study was designed to develop an AI model for LVSD detection in the LBBB population using a limited dataset. ECG data from 508 patients with sinus rhythm and LBBB were labeled based on an LVSD threshold of 35%. To enhance the performance of a model derived from such a small and skewed dataset, we combined an autoencoder-based anomaly detection model with a convolutional neural network (CNN). We used a lead-wise ensemble technique for the final classification. Experimental results showed an accuracy of 0.81, precision of 0.87, recall of 0.56, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 in LVSD prediction among LBBB patients.

In this study, we used the combination of natural abilities of African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus and state-of-the-art bio-logging technology for detecting and locating carcasses in a vast landscape.\r\n2. We used data from two captive and 27 wild vultures to create a reference data set for the training of a support vector machine to distinguish between six behaviour classes based on acceleration data. Next, we combined the classified behaviour of the initial 27 and 7 additional vultures with GPS data and used the ‘Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise’ algorithm to cluster all GPS data to get a position of potential feeding locations. Finally, we used the clustered data set to train a Random Forest algorithm to distinguish between clusters with and without a carcass.\r\nThe behaviour classifier was trained on 14,682 samples for all behaviour classes, which were classified with a high performance (overall precision: 0.95, recall: 0.89). 3. This enabled a ground team to examine 1900 clusters between May 2022 and March 2023 in the field, 580 linked to a carcass and 1320 without a carcass. The cluster classifier trained on this data set was able to correctly distinguish between carcass and no carcass clusters with high performance (overall precision: 0.92, recall: 0.89).\r\n4. Synthesis and applications. We showed that a carcass detection system using vultures, loggers and artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to monitor the mortality of numerous species in a vast landscape. This method has broad applications, such as studying the feeding ecology of vultures, detecting and monitoring of disease outbreaks, environmental poisoning or illegal killing of wildlife. Similar to vultures and carcasses, our methodological framework can be applied to other species to locate their respective food resources. It could also be applied to other types of resources like temporary water sources, roosting sites and to other behaviours such as marking to locate marking sites.']",public,['61(12):2936-2945'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3465-3117', 'prefLabel': 'Rast, Wanja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0686-0701', 'prefLabel': 'Portas, Rubén'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhdHVtYnUsIEdhYnJpZWwgSWl0YQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Shatumbu, Gabriel Iita'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5765-8039', 'prefLabel': 'Berger, Anne'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2xvZXRlLCBDbGF1ZGluZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cloete, Claudine'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9082-6433', 'prefLabel': 'Curk, Teja'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8751-3404', 'prefLabel': 'Götz, Theresa Ida'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7494-3795', 'prefLabel': 'Aschenborn, Hans Karl Ortwin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3490-1515', 'prefLabel': 'Melzheimer, Joerg'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Death detector: Using vultures as sentinels to detect carcasses by combining bio‐logging and machine learning'],2025-06-12T07:42:38.775+0200,336.0

This, in turn, initiated the development of several methods to infer interactions among moving animals. However, the performance of these methods has not been studied systematically, especially with regard to the factors that are highly relevant for field ecologists, such as duration of the tracking period, its temporal resolution and the proportion of the tracked community.\r\n2. Here, we assessed the performance of three dynamic interaction indices (Coefficient of sociality, Correlation coefficient and Dynamic interaction) and two novel approaches based on step selection functions (SSF-occurrence-distribution and SSF-distance). We tested these methods on the data simulated with a predator–prey system, reflecting three common types of interactions while on the move: avoidance (prey individuals fleeing from the predator), attraction (predator following and chasing prey) and neutral movement (no interactions between predator and prey). 3. We assessed the ability of each method to correctly detect the modelled interaction type by manipulating the perceptual range of the predator, the proportion of tracked prey individuals, the temporal resolution and the duration of the tracking period.\r\nWe found that the ability to correctly infer interactions increased for all methods with an increase in the perceptual range of the predator and the proportion of tracked prey individuals. In contrast, the duration of the tracking period affected the methods' performance differently: some methods (Cs and SSF-distance) were insensitive to it, whereas the performance of other methods improved (DI and SSF-occurrence-distribution) and worsened (Cr) with the duration of the tracking period. The three dynamic interaction indices and SSF-distance were rather robust to changes in data resolution.\r\n4. Despite using the predator–prey system as our study case, our findings are applicable to other systems in which two animals on move may interact.

Although research in humans and laboratory mice has shed light into the associations and mechanisms governing this communication network, evidence of such interactions in wild, especially in young animals, is lacking. We therefore investigated these interactions during early development in a population of common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and their effects on individual condition. In a longitudinal study, we used a multi-marker approach to establish potential links between the bacterial and eukaryotic gut microbiota, a panel of immune assays and feather corticosterone measurements as a proxy for long-term stress. Using Bayesian structural equation modeling, we found no support for feedback between gut microbial diversity and immune or stress parameters. However, we did find strong relationships in the feedback network. Immunity was negatively correlated with corticosterone levels, and microbial diversity was positively associated with nestling body condition. Furthermore, corticosterone levels and eukaryotic microbiota diversity decreased with age while immune activity increased. The absence of conclusive support for the microbiota-immune-brain axis in common buzzard nestlings, coupled with the evidence for stress mediated immunosuppression, suggests a dominating role of stress-dominated maturation of the immune system during early development. Confounding factors inherent to wild systems and developing animals might override associations known from adult laboratory model subjects.

With the growth of public MRI repositories, access to data has finally become easier. However, filtering large datasets for potential poor-quality outliers can be a challenge. We present AIDAqc, a machine-learning-assisted automated Python-based command-line tool for small animal MRI quality assessment. Quality control features include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temporal SNR, and motion. All features are automatically calculated and no regions of interest are needed. Automated outlier detection for a given dataset combines the interquartile range and the machine-learning methods one-class support vector machine, isolation forest, local outlier factor, and elliptic envelope. To evaluate the reliability of individual quality control metrics, a simulation of noise (Gaussian, salt and pepper, speckle) and motion was performed. In outlier detection, single scans with induced artifacts were successfully identified by AIDAqc. AIDAqc was challenged in a large heterogeneous dataset collected from 19 international laboratories, including data from mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils, obtained with different hardware and at different field strengths. The results show that the manual inter-rater agreement (mean Fleiss Kappa score 0.17) is low when identifying poor-quality data. A direct comparison of AIDAqc results, therefore, showed only low-to-moderate concordance. In a manual post hoc validation of AIDAqc output, precision was high (>70%). The outlier data can have a significant impact on further postprocessing, as shown in representative functional and structural connectivity analysis. In summary, this pipeline optimized for small animal MRI provides researchers with a valuable tool to efficiently and effectively assess the quality of their MRI data, which is essential for improved reliability and reproducibility.

Although their molar mass and conformation are important to the sensory characteristics of beer and non-alcoholic beer, their triggering mechanism in the mouth is not fully understood. Soft tribology has emerged as a tool to mimic oral processing (drinking). The contribution of each (N)SPs to the friction coefficient can be determined when they are enzymatically isolated and characterized by chromatography techniques. Thus, this work aimed to study the relationship between the physical characteristics of isolated (N)SPs and their possible contribution to oral processing through soft tribology (friction). To accomplish this, this research analyzes the effect of grain source (barley, wheat, and oats) and its modification (by steeping degree at two levels) to the (N)SPs´ physical characteristics in wort produced on a laboratory scale. Different characteristics were present in the (N)SPs due to the grain source and the degree of modification. When comparing the impact of the grain source, the malted oats showed the highest molar masses. A higher modification degree produced smaller and more compact structures except for wheat's arabinoxylans and dextrins. The conformation ratio (\r\n) values indicate the existence of sphere and micro-gel structures within each (N)SPs, with branches in arabinoxylans and dextrins. Subsequently, soft tribology was measured on all the worts and their correlation to the (N)SPs' data was performed by multivariate analysis. The wort produced with high modification grains generated higher friction responses. However, this was only statistically significant in barley samples. The multivariate analysis showed that within the mouth (tongue) velocity, the apparent density of the (N)SPs, and the molar mass of arabinoxylans and β-glucans may influence the friction response and, hence, the oral processing in the mouth during oral processing (drinking).""]",public,['13(1):e4699'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1278-870X', 'prefLabel': 'Moreno Ravelo, Rolando César'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FzdGwsIE1hcnRpbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Gastl, Martina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmVja2VyLCBUaG9tYXM=', 'prefLabel': 'Becker, Thomas'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Relationship Between Physical Characteristics of Cereal Polysaccharides and Soft Tribology—The Importance of Grain Source and Malting Modification'],2025-07-22T12:02:24.736+0200,286.0
frl:6511033,"[""Enhancing the amount of dietary fiber without compromising the quality of noodles remains a challenge in the food industry. This study aimed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted extraction parameters to enhance the yield of nanocellulose from sweet potato residue (SPR) using a response surface methodology. The impact of SPR nanocellulose on noodles' physicochemical properties was also explored. Results showed that the optimal extraction conditions for nanocellulose from SPR were identified as 180.73\u2009U/mL cellulase concentration, 4.28\u2009h ultrasonic time, 444.12\u2009W ultrasonic power, and 14.17\u2009h enzymatic hydrolysis time. The max yield of nanocellulose was 15.93% at optimum extraction conditions. Increasing the amount of SPR nanocellulose resulted in a reduction in the optimal cooking time, water absorption, elongation index, and springiness, as well as an increase in the breaking rate, cooking loss, hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of the noodles. Sensory analysis revealed higher acceptability of the noodles with 6%–12% SPR nanocellulose compared to other treatments. Microstructure demonstrated that noodles with 0%–18% SPR nanocellulose exhibited fewer holes and denser network structures, but higher SPR nanocellulose damaged the protein network. Those findings suggested that noodles with less than 12% SPR nanocellulose exhibited higher quality. This research provided the foundation for the development of nanocellulose-enriched foods.""]",public,['12(11):9175-9186'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2FvLCBYdWVsaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Gao, Xueli'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4459-3621', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Guanghui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgWW9uZ2h1aQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Yonghui'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBXZWl5dW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Weiyun'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGUsIFNoZW5naHVh', 'prefLabel': 'He, Shenghua'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIEppaG9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Jihong'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Ultrasonic-assisted extraction of nanocellulose from sweet potato residue and its application in noodles'],2025-04-14T12:38:42.719+0200,286.0

This study evaluated the potential of the wheat variety NARC-2011 for cookie production, focusing on nutritional enhancement by adding white sesame seeds at different proportions (5%, 10%, and 15%) to both whole and fine wheat flour. White sesame seeds were added to cookies mainly for their visual appeal, creating a nice contrast with the dough. They also have a mild flavor that complements the cookie without overwhelming it. Besides, they pack essential nutrients like protein, fiber, calcium, and iron, making the cookies more nutritious. The physical, chemical, and sensory properties of the different cookies were evaluated using standard methods. In terms of physical parameters, fine wheat flour cookies exhibited a diameter (46.45–50.47\u2009mm), thickness (8.47–9.77\u2009mm), and spreading factor (5.16–5.46\u2009mm), and whole wheat flour cookies exhibited a diameter (48.47–52.31\u2009mm), thickness (9.22–10.73\u2009mm), and spreading factor (4.87–5.25\u2009mm). Chemical analysis revealed moisture (5.78%–7.66%), fat (10.89%–16.16%), fiber (6.10%–8.46%), ash (4.82%–7.40%), protein (0.74%–1.40%), non-fiber carbohydrates (63.67%–67.55%) for fine wheat flour cookies, and moisture (5.67%–7.39%), fat (10.89%–16.16%), fiber (11.47%–15.98%), ash (0.54%–0.83%), protein (5.65%–8.13%), non-fiber carbohydrates (57.86%–66.55%), total phenolic content (2.86\u2009mg/g), flavonoids (1.46\u2009mg/g), and antioxidant activity (80.76%) in whole wheat flour cookies with sesame fortification. Gas chromatography revealed higher unsaturated fatty acids (83.22%) in NARC-2011 wheat oil compared to white sesame seed oil (79.78%). In sensory evaluations, cookies fortified with 10% sesame seeds in fine wheat flour received the highest level of acceptability from the panelists. On the other hand, cookies made from whole wheat flour fortified with 15% sesame seeds garnered the maximum acceptability ratings from the panelists. In conclusion, supplementing NARC-2011 wheat flour with sesame seeds, whether in fine or whole wheat form, improves the quality of cookies and nutritional content while offering appropriate sensory attributes at particular sesame seed levels.']",public,['12(10):7751-7765'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TmFxdmksIFNpdHRhcmEgTm9vcmk=', 'prefLabel': 'Naqvi, Sittara Noori'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGlhcXVhdCwgTXVoYW1tYWQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Liaquat, Muhammad'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5009-483X', 'prefLabel': 'Kazmi, Abeer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FtbWksIFNoZWxsYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Sammi, Shella'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWxpLCBBbWly', 'prefLabel': 'Ali, Amir'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/THVuYS1BcmlhcywgSnVhbiBQZWRybw==', 'prefLabel': 'Luna-Arias, Juan Pedro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlcnphZCwgSXp6YXQgVWxsYWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Sherzad, Izzat Ullah'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Sesame-enriched delights: A comparative exploration of physicochemical and sensory attributes in fine and whole wheat flour cookies'],2025-03-10T13:40:15.206+0100,286.0

The present study was designed to determine the phytoconstituents, antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, and antimicrobial activities of the methanolic extract from the leaves of these two Senna species. A total of 75 phenolic compounds belonging to dihydroxybenzoic acids, dihydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoid C-glycosides, flavonoid O-glycosides, flavonoid aglycones, anthraquinone glycosides, and anthraquinone aglycones were identified. Flavonoid C-glycosides were only found in S.\u2009occidentalis while sennosides A, B, and C were only detected in S.\u2009alata. In line with its higher total phenolic and flavonoids contents, S.\u2009alata exerted significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) higher antiradical (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazy (DPPH)\u2009=\u200958.36\u2009mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g; 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS)\u2009=\u2009118.86\u2009mg TE/g), ions reducing (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC)\u2009=\u200993.85\u2009mg TE/g; ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)\u2009=\u200950.42\u2009mg TE/g), and total antioxidant (1.39\u2009mmol TE/g) activities than S.\u2009occidentalis. S.\u2009alata revealed significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) higher inhibitory effect against butyrylcholinesterase (1.67\u2009mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g), tyrosinase (45.07\u2009mg KAE/g) 45.07\u2009mg kojic acid equivalent (KAE)/g), α-glucosidase (0.73\u2009mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g), and α-amylase (2.95\u2009mmol ACAE/g) enzymes. Both species showed high antibacterial and antifungal activities with remarkable antifungal activity exerted by S.\u2009alata against Trichoderma viride (minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) 1\u2009mg/mL), similar to that of Ketoconazole. The study utilized molecular docking, molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the binding interactions between anthraquinone glycosides and various bacterial enzymes, including targets from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The findings suggest that compounds like sennoside A, sennoside B, and chrysophanol exhibit strong binding affinities, stable interactions, and potential as antimicrobial inhibitors, especially against vital bacterial proteins such as MurE and 30S ribosome S3. In conclusion, our findings underscore the biopharmaceutical potential of these two Senna species, suggesting their significance as sources of bioactive agents for health-related applications.']",public,['13(1):e4705'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9600-3526', 'prefLabel': 'Yagi, Sakina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2V0aXosIE1laG1ldCBWZXlzaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Cetiz, Mehmet Veysi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6548-7823', 'prefLabel': 'Zengin, Gokhan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFrYXIsIEthc3NpbQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Bakar, Kassim'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGltaWRpLCBBemFsaSBBaGFtYWRh', 'prefLabel': 'Himidi, Azali Ahamada'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9oYW1lZCwgQW5kaWx5YXQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Mohamed, Andilyat'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2tvcmnEhywgTWFyaWphbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Skorić, Marijana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2xhbW-EjWxpamEsIEphc21pbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Glamočlija, Jasmina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2HFoWnEhywgVXJvxaE=', 'prefLabel': 'Gašić, Uroš'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Novel Natural Candidates for Replacing Synthetic Additives in Nutraceutical and Pharmaceutical Areas: Two Senna Species (S.\u2009alata (L.)

This study was designed as a 6\u2009month intervention study. The main objective was to evaluate the effect of an energy deficit (10%, 20%, and 25%—groups D10, D20, and D25, respectively) on the rate of weight loss and waist and hip circumferences. The protocol was completed by 180 participants. Men as well as women comprised 90 patients each. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.5\u2009±\u20095.0\u2009kg/m2 (min 21.3–max 49.2). Among the patients, there were 86 with a BMI indicating overweight. Fifty-four patients had class 1 obesity, while the remaining 30 patients had class 2 or greater obesity. After 6\u2009months of intervention, the D10 group noted a 7.6% (median) reduction in weight, the D20 group a 9.9% (median) reduction in weight, and the D25 group a 10.3% (median) reduction in weight. After the intervention, 51.7% of patients chose to continue further weight reduction already outside the research protocol. Key factors influencing the willingness to stay on the diet longer than 6\u2009months were higher baseline body weight and/or higher BMI and a rate of weight loss of at least 1.5% of body weight per month. In summary, it appears that a larger energy deficit (on the order of 20%–25%) is most appropriate in terms of weight loss lasting 6\u2009months and motivation for continued therapy.']",public,['12(11):8920-8929'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8190-8659', 'prefLabel': 'Woźniak, Jakub'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2-Fum5pYWssIEthdGFyenluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Woźniak, Katarzyna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFqdGVsLCBLb3JuZWxpYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Pajtel, Kornelia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3J6b3NlaywgTWljaGHFgg==', 'prefLabel': 'Wrzosek, Michał'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V8WCb2RhcmVrLCBEYXJpdXN6', 'prefLabel': 'Włodarek, Dariusz'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The impact of the size of the energy deficit on the rate of body weight in 6\u2009months and willingness to continue reduction program conducted online–An intervention study'],2025-04-07T13:01:51.471+0200,286.0

However, the widespread and inappropriate use of carbapenems can lead to carbapenem resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of amikacin and carbapenems in the management of pediatric acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae. \r\nMETHODS: We analyzed cases of pediatric acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae that were treated with either carbapenems or amikacin over a two-year period. This study compared microbiological cure, clinical improvement, and recurrence rates across the amikacin and carbapenem treatment groups. \r\nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients were evaluated. The median age of the patients was 3 years (range, 0.1–13 years). The causative agents were E. coli in 43 cases (78.2%) and Klebsiella spp. in 12 cases (21.8%). All were susceptible to both carbapenem and amikacin in vitro. Twenty patients (36.3%) received a carbapenem and thirty-five (63.7%) received amikacin. Twenty-four (43.6%) had an underlying urological disease. No difference was observed between the groups in terms of microbiological cure, clinical improvement, or recurrence rates.

We developed a barley pan-transcriptome using 20 inbred genotypes representing domesticated barley diversity by generating and analyzing short- and long-read RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple tissues. To overcome single reference bias in transcript quantification, we constructed genotype-specific reference transcript datasets (RTDs) and integrated these into a linear pan-genome framework to create a pan-RTD, allowing transcript categorization as core, shell or cloud. Focusing on the core (expressed in all genotypes), we observed significant transcript abundance variation among tissues and between genotypes driven partly by RNA processing, gene copy number, structural rearrangements and conservation of promotor motifs. Network analyses revealed conserved co-expression module::tissue correlations and frequent functional diversification. To complement the pan-transcriptome, we constructed a comprehensive cultivar (cv.) Morex gene-expression atlas and illustrate how these combined datasets can be used to guide biological inquiry.']",public,['57(2):441-450'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1829-6044',

frl:6501015,"['BACKGROUND: Neuropathic adverse events occur frequently in linezolid-containing regimens, some of which remain irreversible after drug discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and validate a host RNA-based biomarker that can predict linezolid-associated neuropathy before multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) treatment initiation and to identify genes and pathways that are associated with linezolid-associated neuropathy. METHODS: Adult patients initiating MDR/RR-TB treatment including linezolid were prospectively enrolled in 3 independent cohorts in Germany. Clinical data and whole blood RNA for transcriptomic analysis were collected. The primary outcome was linezolid-associated optic and/or peripheral neuropathy. A random forest algorithm was used for biomarker identification. The biomarker was validated in an additional fourth cohort of patients with MDR/RR-TB from Romania. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients from the 3 identification cohorts received linezolid treatment. Of those, 24 (46.2%) developed peripheral and/or optic neuropathies during linezolid treatment. The majority (59.3%) of the episodes were of moderate (grade 2) severity. In total, the expression of 1,479 genes differed significantly at baseline of treatment. Suprabasin (SBSN) was identified as a potential biomarker to predict linezolid-associated neuropathy. In the validation cohort, 10 of 42 (23.8%) patients developed grade ≥3 neuropathies.

These digital formats bring forth distinct advantages and challenges that should be carefully considered. This rapid review aims to present an overview of digital formats employed in participatory health intervention development and their reported benefits and barriers. DESIGN: A qualitative rapid review was conducted, following recommendations by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. The literature search was carried out in October 2022 and encompassed the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Studies were included if they were published in 2010 or later and reported the development of a health-related intervention employing digital formats in the participatory process.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 22 studies were included. We identified three types of digital formats used for participatory health intervention development: web-based participatory formats (n\u2009=\u200914), digital participatory visual formats (n\u2009=\u20095), and digital participatory mapping (n\u2009=\u20093). The reported benefits of applying digital formats included enhanced participant anonymity, increased time and cost efficiency, and more flexibility regarding scheduling and extent of participation. Among the reported barriers were sufficient internet connectivity, required technical skills, and online fatigue. CONCLUSION: The review shows a variety of digital formats employed to develop participatory health interventions. Yet, these methods are primarily digital adaptations of pre-existing analog formats. Innovative digital approaches involving, for example, virtual reality devices remain largely unused. The review also revealed a need for establishing shared terminology and reporting standards to facilitate communication, comparison, and synthesis of findings in this evolving area of research.']",public,['12:1461422'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RG9lcndhbGQsIEZyaWVkZXJpa2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Doerwald, Friederike'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RhbGxpbmcsIElta2U=', 'prefLabel': 'Stalling, Imke'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmVja2UsIENhcmluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Recke, Carina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6043-9072', 'prefLabel': 'Busse, Heide'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hyZXN0aGEsIFJlaGFuYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Shrestha, Rehana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5241-0253', 'prefLabel': 'Rach, Stefan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFtbWFubiwgS2FyaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Bammann, Karin'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['A rapid review of digital approaches for the participatory development of health-related interventions'],2025-07-14T14:46:04.240+0200,266.0

The gene encoding the MYELOCYTOMATOSIS 2 (MYC2) transcription factor is potentially responsible for the blue coloration of the aleurone. In non-pigmented barley, a single nucleotide insertion in this gene causes a frameshift mutation with a premature stop codon. It was hypothesized that restoring the MYC2 reading frame could activate anthocyanin accumulation in the aleurone. Using a targeted mutagenesis approach in the present study, the reading frame of MYC2 was restored in the non-pigmented cultivar Golden Promise. Genetic constructs harboring cas9 and gRNA expression units were developed, pre-validated in protoplasts, and then functional MYC2 alleles were generated at the plant level via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Anthocyanin accumulation in the aleurone layer of grains from these mutants was confirmed through microscopy and chemical analysis. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes was analyzed, revealing that the restoration of MYC2 led to increased transcript levels of F3H and ANS genes. These results confirm the critical role of the MYC2 transcription factor in the blue aleurone trait and provide a biotechnological solution for enriching barley grain with anthocyanins.']",public,['25(23):12705'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6745-3077', 'prefLabel': 'Egorova, Anastasiya'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7786-1736', 'prefLabel': 'Zykova, Tatyana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2320-7579', 'prefLabel': 'Hertig, Christian'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1666-8585', 'prefLabel': 'Hoffie, Iris'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9yb3pvdiwgU2VyZ2V5IFY=', 'prefLabel': 'Morozov, Sergey V'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1669-7864', 'prefLabel': 'Chernyak, Elena'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3338-8529', 'prefLabel': 'Rogachev, Artem'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1540-1491', 'prefLabel': 'Korotkova, Anna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmlraG9yZXYsIEFsZXhhbmRlciBW', 'prefLabel': 'Vikhorev, Alexander V'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0929-6832', 'prefLabel': 'Vasiliev, Gennady'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5289-8631', 'prefLabel': 'Shoeva, Olesya'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7080-7983', 'prefLabel': 'Kumlehn, Jochen'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8626-1831', 'prefLabel': 'Gerasimova, Sophia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8470-8254', 'prefLabel': 'Khlestkina, Elena'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Accumulation of anthocyanin in the aleurone of barley grains by targeted restoration of the MYC2 gene'],2025-02-10T15:41:00.056+0100,325.0

METHODS: A total of 143 patients (≥18 years of age) were diagnosed with isolated CCTGA at Anzhen Hospital. The patients were classified as the operation group and the non-operation group depending on whether they had undergone tricuspid valve surgery. The echocardiographic data and follow-up were compared, and the primary outcomes examined were defined as death or heart transplantation. RESULTS: The average age of 143 patients with isolated CCTGA was 39.93 ± 13.50 years. Tricuspid valve surgery was performed in 31 patients with isolated CCTGA, and 112 patients did not undergo tricuspid valve surgery. The incidence of tricuspid valve structural changes in the operation group was 39.1%, and this group had higher numbers of patients with right ventricular diastolic diameter, right ventricular systolic diameter, left atrial dimensions, and regurgitation before surgery compared with the non-operation group (p < 0.05). Follow-up results showed no significant difference in the number of death/heart transplantations, and the incidence of systemic ventricular ejection fraction (SVEF) < 40% between the two groups. The survival rate of the surgery group was higher than that of the non-surgery group, although not statistically significant (p = 0.123). Age, right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased SVEF at the first diagnosis are independent predictive risk factors for major adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with isolated CCTGA may have structural abnormalities in their tricuspid valves. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse outcomes, morphological right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and survival between the surgery group and the non-surgery group. However, this study is a retrospective study, and the sample size of the surgical group is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the research conclusions.

frl:6525159,"['BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been widely investigated as a predictor of disease and mortality across diverse patient populations; however, there remains no consensus on the optimal set or combination of time and frequency domain nor on nonlinear features for reliable prediction across clinical contexts. Given the relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unique clinical profiles of these patients, this retrospective observational study explored the potential of HRV analysis for early prediction of in-hospital mortality using ECG signals recorded during the initial moments of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: HRV indices were extracted from four ECG leads (I, II, III, and aVF) using sliding windows of 2, 5, and 7 min across observation intervals of 15, 30, and 60 min. The raw data posed significant challenges in terms of structure, synchronization, and signal quality; thus, from an original set of 381 records from 321 patients, after data pre-processing steps, a final dataset of 82 patients was selected for analysis. To manage data complexity and evaluate predictive performance, two feature selection methods, four feature reduction techniques, and five classification models were applied to identify the optimal approach. RESULTS: Among the feature aggregation methods, compiling feature means across patient windows (Method D) yielded the best results, particularly for longer observation intervals (e.g., using LDA, the best AUC of 0.82±0.130.82±0.13 was obtained with Method D versus 0.63±0.090.63±0.09 with Method C using 5 min windows). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was the most consistent classification algorithm, demonstrating robust performance across various time windows and further improvement with dimensionality reduction. Although Gradient Boosting and Random Forest also achieved high AUCs and F1-scores, their performance outcomes varied across time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of using short-term HRV as a noninvasive, data-driven tool for early risk stratification in critical care, potentially guiding timely therapeutic decisions in high-risk ICU patients and thereby reducing in-hospital mortality.\r\n\r\n']",public,['14(15):5312'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-3540-9636', 'prefLabel': 'de Azevedo David, Guilherme'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-9578', 'prefLabel': 'Lourenço, André'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0009-6843-1935', 'prefLabel': 'Von Rekowski, Cristiana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2945-1441', 'prefLabel': 'Pinto, Iola'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5264-9755', 'prefLabel': 'Calado, Cecília'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/IEJlbnRvLCBMdcOtcw==', 'prefLabel': ' Bento, Luís'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Analyzing Heart Rate Variability for COVID-19 ICU Mortality Prediction Using Continuous Signal Processing Techniques'],2025-07-28T10:25:14.700+0200,355.0

Recent studies suggest that air pollution is potentially linked to arthritis onset, although current research predominantly focuses on the effects of particulate matter (PM2.5). There is a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the influence of various particulate pollutants and their key constituents on arthritis prevalence. This research used China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data and explored the associations between arthritis prevalence and different particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10, and PM1,\u2009≤\u20092.5 micrometers,\u2009≤\u200910 micrometers, and ≤ 1 micrometer in diameter, respectively), as well as ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3), with gaseous pollutants [such as sulfate (SO4) and ozone (O3)] as a reference.\r\n\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThis study was conducted based on the 2015 CHARLS cross-sectional data, and 3,802 participants were included. The levels of air pollution exposure were estimated using a spatial-temporal extreme random forest model, integrating ground monitoring, remote sensing data, and model simulations, encompassing PM1, PM2.5, PM10, NH4, NO3, O3, and SO4 concentrations. The association of air pollution with arthritis prevalence was assessed utilizing generalized linear models (GLM), while adjusting for various confounding variables.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\nLong-term exposure to PM₁, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NH₄\u2009⁺\u2009, and NO₃\u2009⁻\u2009was positively associated with self-reported arthritis prevalence. Specifically, each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM₁ corresponded to 4.4% higher odds of arthritis (odds ratio [OR] per IQR: 1.044; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011–1.070), indicating a modest association. Subsequent ORs per IQR for PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ were 1.019 (95% CI: 1.004–1.036) and 1.012 (95% CI: 1.002–1.021), respectively, reflecting similar but smaller positive associations, whereas NH₄⁺ and NO₃\u2009⁻\u2009showed moderate associations with ORs per IQR of 1.143 (95% CI: 1.017–1.285) and 1.082 (95% CI: 1.011–1.159), respectively. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a significant association between long-term exposure to PM₁, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀ and the secondary inorganic aerosol constituents NH₄ and NO₃, and the prevalence of self-reported arthritis in middle-aged and older adults. However, owing to its cross-sectional design, the absence of subtype differentiation and reliance on self-reported diagnoses, these findings may be influenced by reverse causation and measurement error, and should therefore be interpreted with caution.\r\n']",public,['20(7):e0327695'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWUsIFl1bnRpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Ye, Yuntian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIEt1aXpoaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Kuizhi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-1277', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Aifeng'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Associations between ambient particulate matter exposure and the prevalence of arthritis: Findings from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study'],2025-07-11T08:18:17.060+0200,355.0

However, the mechanisms behind these properties of FAMCGSE remain unclear. This study explores the anti-inflammatory effects of FAMCGS extract (FAMCGSE) on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and the underlying mechanisms. The MTT assay confirmed that FAMCGSE (0 to 0.1%) maintained cell viability without inducing morphological changes. Pretreatment with FAMCGSE significantly mitigated LPS-induced morphological alterations dose-dependently. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that FAMCGSE significantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2. Additionally, FAMCGSE decreased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide, and PGE2 in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, FAMCGSE inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; ERK, p38, and JNK) and prevented the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, with effects comparable to compound K (CK) or dexamethasone. Notably, FAMCGSE was particularly effective in inhibiting ERK and JNK activation, with less impact on p38, suggesting a specific inhibitory action on certain MAPK pathways. These findings highlight FAMCGSE's potential as an inhibitor of MAPK and NF-κB pathways, indicating that FAMCGSE, including its main component CK, may be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammation-related conditions.""]",public,['12(11):9566-9576'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FvLCBEYW5nIExvbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Cao, Dang Long'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V29vLCBNaW4tU2Vvaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Woo, Min-Seok'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2ltLCBFdW4tSmlu', 'prefLabel': 'Kim, Eun-Jin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWhuLCBCeWVvbmdneXU=', 'prefLabel': 'Ahn, Byeonggyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHJheW9nYSwgQW5qYXMgSGFwcHk=', 'prefLabel': 'Prayoga, Anjas Happy'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FuZywgU2FuZyBTb28=', 'prefLabel': 'Kang, Sang Soo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hvLCBLeWUgTWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Cho, Kye Man'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7402-7298', 'prefLabel': 'Kang, Dawon'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Fermented and Aged Mountain-Cultivated Ginseng Sprouts via Suppression of MAPK-NF-κB Pathway in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated RAW264.7 Macrophages'],2025-05-08T12:58:28.567+0200,286.0

Eruca sativa, member of the Brassicaceae family, is valued in traditional medicine and renowned for its rich iron and vitamin C content. This study aims to evaluate the anti-anemic properties of E. sativa extract in vivo and identify its compounds targeting anemia mechanisms using network pharmacology. Thirty-two Sprague–Dawley rats (200\u2009±\u2009250\u2009g) were split into two distinct groups, iron-deficient and iron-sufficient. Three different doses (200, 400, and 800\u2009mg/kg) of aqueous extract of E. sativa were checked against anemia by studying hematological, oxidative stress, and histopathological parameters. GC–MS analysis of E. sativa revealed its phytochemical profile, followed by ADME screening. Network pharmacology explored targets related to iron deficiency anemia, with oral bioavailability and drug likeness assessment for compounds. The administration of extracts significantly improved various blood parameters, including osmotic fragility, Hb, RBCs, MCV, PCV, and alkaline phosphatase; catalase activity; and histopathological parameters such as liver in both iron-deficient and iron-sufficient rats (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Seventy-nine compounds were identified in E. sativa aqueous extract, with only six of them found to be bioavailable and drug-like against multiple targets. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed their diverse molecular, biological, and cellular functions. One gene EGFR was found to have functional association with ID anemia, suggesting potential for using E. sativa extracts. The study concludes that E. sativa extract has potential for iron deficiency anemia treatment, offering hope for future pharmaceutical interventions.']",public,['12(10):7331-7346'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmF2ZWQsIFNhbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Javed, Sana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hhaHphZGksIFphaW5hYg==', 'prefLabel': 'Shahzadi, Zainab'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8710-3915', 'prefLabel': 'Yousaf, Zubaida'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5884-8950', 'prefLabel': 'Anjum, Dr. Irfan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QWZ0YWIsIEFydXNh', 'prefLabel': 'Aftab, Arusa'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuaWYsIFNhbWluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Hanif, Samina'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFxYm9vbCwgWmFpbmFi', 'prefLabel': 'Maqbool, Zainab'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VWxsYWgsIFJpYXo=', 'prefLabel': 'Ullah, Riaz'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmF6YSwgTXVoYW1tYWQgQWhtZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Raza, Muhammad Ahmer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SXFiYWwsIFphZmFy', 'prefLabel': 'Iqbal, Zafar'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Anti-anemic potential of Eruca sativa L. in iron-deficient rat model; network pharmacology profiling'],2025-01-30T13:14:10.299+0100,286.0
frl:6510383,"['BACKGROUND: Digital public health (DiPH) interventions may help us tackle substantial public health challenges and reach historically underserved populations, in addition to presenting valuable opportunities to improve and complement existing services. However, DiPH interventions are often triggered through technological advancements and opportunities rather than public health needs. To develop and evaluate interventions designed to serve public health needs, a comprehensive framework is needed that systematically covers all aspects with relevance for public health. This includes considering the complexity of the technology, the context in which the technology is supposed to operate, its implementation, and its effects on public health, including ethical, legal, and social aspects. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop such a DiPH framework with a comprehensive list of core principles to be considered throughout the development and evaluation process of any DiPH intervention. METHODS: The resulting digital public health framework (DigiPHrame) was based on a scoping review of existing digital health and public health frameworks. After extracting all assessment criteria from these frameworks, we clustered the criteria. During a series of multidisciplinary meetings with experts from the Leibniz ScienceCampus Digital Public Health, we restructured each domain to represent the complexity of DiPH. In this paper, we used a COVID-19 contact–tracing app as a use case to illustrate how DigiPHrame may be applied to assess DiPH interventions. RESULTS: The current version of DigiPHrame consists of 182 questions nested under 12 domains. Domain 1 describes the current status of health needs and existing interventions; domains 2 and 3, the DiPH technology under assessment and aspects related to human-computer interaction, respectively; domains 4 and 5, structural and process aspects, respectively; and domains 6-12, contextual conditions and the outcomes of the DiPH intervention from broad perspectives. In the CWA use case, a number of questions relevant during its development but also important for assessors once the CWA was available were highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: DigiPHrame is a comprehensive framework for the development and assessment of digital technologies designed for public health purposes. It is a living framework and will, therefore, be updated regularly and as new public health needs and technological advancements emerge.']",public,['26:e54269'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-4574', 'prefLabel': 'Jahnel, Tina'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2710-3259', 'prefLabel': 'Pan, Chen-Chia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6687-3600', 'prefLabel': 'Pedrós Barnils, Núria '}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8650-8395', 'prefLabel': 'Muellmann, Saskia'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9895-9997', 'prefLabel': 'Freye, Merle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3586-0695', 'prefLabel': 'Dassow, Hans-Henrik'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9780-7334', 'prefLabel': 'Lange, Oliver'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6389-6436', 'prefLabel': 'Reinschluessel, Anke V.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1625-4171', 'prefLabel': 'Rogowski, Wolf'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3637-7419', 'prefLabel': 'Gerhardus, Ansgar'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Developing and evaluating digital public health interventions using the digital public health framework DigiPHrame: A framework development study'],2025-03-11T11:25:32.216+0100,266.0

Psoriasis can appear at any age and occurs around the world. The pathogenesis of psoriasis has not been fully elucidated, and there is currently no effective treatment method in clinical practice. Broussonetia papyrifera is a traditional Chinese medicine that exhibited a significant therapeutic effect on psoriasis in our previous study due to its remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. However, its mechanism of action in treating psoriasis is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-psoriasis effect of the B. papyrifera leaves extract (PLE) in vivo and to explore its potential effects. PLE effectively alleviated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like lesions, reduced psoriasis lesion area and severity index, decreased epidermal hyperplasia, ameliorated the oxidative stress-induced changes in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A. PLE can also reduce the protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF-κBp65, p-IκBα, p-PI3K and p-AKT induced by IMQ model. Our findings suggest that PLE is effective in improving psoriasis-like symptoms, which might be ascribed to the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB and PI3K/AKT inflammation pathway. Our study demonstrates the potential mechanism of a natural source of PLE for the treatment of psoriasis. However, it is important to note that these findings lack clinical validation, and further studies are required to validate these results in clinical settings. Additionally, PLE shows potential in being a cost-effective alternative compared to existing biologics, which could have broader implications for psoriasis treatment in the future.']",public,['20(5):e0322710'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIFhpYW9xaWFuZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Xiaoqiang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgTGk=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Li'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWEsIFhpYW95aW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Ma, Xiaoying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGl1LCBTaHVuaGU=', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Shunhe'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbywgSG9uZ2NoYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Zhao, Hongchang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFBlbmdibw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Pengbo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIExpeWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Liyan'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5581-893X', 'prefLabel': ', wanli'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmlhLCBBbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Jia, An'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Broussonetia papyrifera ameliorates imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice by modulating the TLR4/NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways'],2025-05-08T14:05:07.066+0200,337.0

Despite this, the pathological mechanisms underlying these conditions are often difficult to unravel. Conventional techniques like immunohistochemistry or dye-based approaches, do not provide a temporal characterization of the pathophysiological aberrations responsible for myelin changes in human specimens. Here, to circumvent this curb, we present a label-free, live-cell imaging approach of myelin using recent advancements in nonlinear harmonic generation microscopy applied to physiologically viable human brain tissue from post-mortem donors. Gray and white matter brain tissue from epilepsy surgery and post-mortem donors was excised. To sustain viability of the specimens for several hours, they were subjected to either acute or organotypic slice culture protocols in artificial cerebral spinal fluid. Imaging was performed using a femtosecond pulsed 1050\u2009nm laser to generate second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) signals directly from myelin and axon-like structures without the need to add any labels. Experiments on acute human brain slices and post-mortem human slice cultures reveal that myelin, along with lipid bodies, are the prime sources of THG signal. We show that tissue viability is maintained over extended periods during THG microscopy, and that prolonged THG imaging is able to detect experimentally induced subtle alterations in myelin morphology. Finally, we provide practical evidence that live-cell imaging of myelin with THG microscopy is a sensitive tool to investigate subtle changes in white matter of neurological donors.']",public,['20(3):e0310663'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2561-0206', 'prefLabel': 'Meijns, Niels'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qmxva2tlciwgTWF4', 'prefLabel': 'Blokker, Max'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWRlbWEsIFNhbmRlcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Idema, Sander'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmV0YSwgTWl0a28=', 'prefLabel': 'Veta, Mitko'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RXR0ZW1hLCBMb2Vz', 'prefLabel': 'Ettema, Loes'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/dmFuIEllcnNlbCwgSnVsaWV0', 'prefLabel': 'van Iersel, Juliet'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFpoaXFpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Zhiqing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NoZW5rLCBHZWVydCBKLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Schenk, Geert J.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3Jvb3QsIE1hcmllIExvdWlzZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Groot, Marie Louise'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0189-4347', 'prefLabel': 'Luchicchi, Antonio'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Dynamic imaging of myelin pathology in physiologically preserved human brain tissue using third harmonic generation microscopy'],2025-04-01T14:10:45.278+0200,337.0

Nevertheless, the causal correlation between SP and serum metabolites, and the biological signaling pathways involved, is still not well understood. We performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal relationships between 1091 levels and 309 ratios of metabolites with SP traits, alongside investigating the relevant biological signaling pathways. Additionally, we explored the differential expression of plasma metabolites and potential biological signaling pathways in an animal model of SP. When SP was utilized as the outcome, we identified 11 robust causal associations between seven metabolite levels/ratios and SP-related traits using Bonferroni's correction (threshold: p\u2009<\u20090.05). We verified the stable causal association of glycine levels and SP in the validation. As for the reverse MR analysis, there were 11 strong causal relationships with 11 plasma metabolite levels/ratios remaining after multiple contrast correction. Additionally, biological signaling pathway analysis showed that glycine metabolism, insulin resistance, and cAMP signaling pathways may contribute to the connection between metabolites and SP. Mendelian validation of various datasets and observations in animal serum metabolomics suggests a strong association between glycine metabolism and SP. Our results indicate that the identified metabolites and biosignaling pathways could serve as important circulatory metabolic biomarkers for the screening and prevention of SP in clinical settings.

This study aimed to characterize and contrast the daily patterns, frequency and intensity of physical activity bouts between people post stroke with different ambulation statuses compared to healthy controls. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this cross-sectional study, physical activity bouts patterns, frequencies, and intensities were evaluated using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers across three groups: 17 limited community ambulators (LCA) post-stroke (walking speed:\u2009<\u20090.8 m/s), 22 community ambulators (CA) post-stroke (walking speed:\u2009≥\u20090.8 m/s), and 28 healthy controls. RESULTS: People post stroke primarily engaged in 1–5\u2009min bouts (LCA: 79%, CA: 76%), with less frequent engagement in 5–10\u2009min (12–14%) and\u2009>\u200910\u2009min bouts (9–10%) during the day.

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gPM+ in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among Syrian refugees in Istanbul, Türkiye. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 368 distressed (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K10 > 15) adult Syrian refugees with impaired functioning (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0 > 16). Participants were recruited between August 2019 and September 2020 through a non-governmental organization providing services to refugees. Participants were randomly allocated to gPM+ and enhanced care as usual (gPM+/E-CAU) (184 participants) or E-CAU only (184 participants). Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25)) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5; PCL-5), functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0), and self-identified problems (psychological outcome profiles). RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect of gPM+ on symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD and self-identified problems. Yet, there was a significant reduction in functional impairment in gPM+/E-CAU compared to E-CAU at 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference 1.66, 95 % CI 0.04, 3.27, p = 0.045, d = 0.19). Post-hoc subgroup analyses among participants with probable baseline depression or anxiety showed that there was a small but significant reduction in depression (adjusted mean difference −0.17, 95 % CI −0.32, −0.02, p = 0.028, d = 0.27) and anxiety (adjusted mean difference −0.21, 95 % CI −0.37, −0.05, p = 0.009, d = 0.30) symptoms comparing gPM+/E-CAU to E-CAU only at 1-week post assessment, but not at 3-month follow-up. There was a significant difference between conditions on functional impairment at 3-month follow-up, favouring gPM+/E-CAU condition (adjusted mean difference −1.98, 95 % CI −3.93, −0.02, p = 0.048, d = 0.26). CONCLUSION: In this study in an urban setting in Türkiye, gPM+ did not alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety among Syrian refugees experiencing psychological distress and daily living difficulties. However, participants with higher distress at baseline seemed to benefit from gPM+, but treatment gains disappeared in the long term. Current findings highlight the potential benefit of tailored psychosocial interventions for highly distressed refugees in volatile low-resource settings.']",public,['33:e43'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7093-1554', 'prefLabel': 'Acarturk, Ceren '}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S3VydCwgRy4=', 'prefLabel': 'Kurt, G.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SWtrdXJzdW4sIFou', 'prefLabel': 'Ikkursun, Z.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6686-4432', 'prefLabel': 'de Graaff, Anne'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9607-819X', 'prefLabel': 'Bryant, Richard'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5497-2743', 'prefLabel': 'Cuijpers, Pim'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9020-4629', 'prefLabel': 'Fuhr, Daniela'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWNEYWlkLCBEYXZpZA==', 'prefLabel': 'McDaid, David'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFyaywgQS1MYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Park, A-La'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5430-9810', 'prefLabel': 'Sijbrandij, Marit'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Effectiveness of group problem management plus in distressed Syrian refugees in Türkiye: a randomized controlled trial'],2025-02-12T09:59:16.084+0100,266.0

This study aimed to explore the bone protective effect of aqueous extract of Eucommia ulmoides (EUL) in DOP mice. DOP mice were established using a high-sugar, high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) (35\u2009mg/kg for three consecutive days), and the EUL aqueous extract (2.5\u2009g/kg/day) was orally administered for 6\u2009weeks. The serum levels of oxidative stress-related factors, calcium, and phosphorus were assessed using biochemical assays. The osteoprotective effect of EUL was assessed using micro-computer tomography, three-point bending assay, histological analysis, and immunoblotting. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect the expression levels of calcium transport channel factors in the kidney and small intestine tissues. Furthermore, the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the femur, kidney, and small intestine tissues were detected using western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. EUL aqueous extract reduced blood glucose levels, increased body weight, and relieved symptoms in DOP mice (p\u2009<\u2009.05). It also increased bone mineral density, improved the bone microstructure, decreased the number of femoral osteoclasts, and increased the expression of femoral Runx2 and Bmp2 in DOP mice (p\u2009<\u2009.01). After 6\u2009weeks of EUL aqueous extract administration, serum levels of SOD, CTA, calcium, and phosphorus were upregulated, whereas MDA levels were decreased (p\u2009<\u2009.01).

This study comparatively investigated the effects of boiling and roasting on nutritional components contents, taste, and aroma to reveal the advantages of roasting in terms of the nutrition and flavor of peanuts. Results showed that boiling increased fat content to 54.47% of peanuts, diluted or reduced sugar content to an undetectable level, noticeably changed the contents of poly/monounsaturated fatty acids, and significantly decreased the content of free amino acid (FAA, 1.05\u2009mg/g peanuts) in peanuts. Roasting simply decreased the contents of sugar and FAA to 2.78 and 1.82\u2009mg/g peanuts, respectively. Compared with roasting, boiling had more discernible effects on fatty acids and FAAs. Both BPs and OPs have good dietary lipid quality. In terms of flavor, OPs had more FAAs (2 types) that contributed remarkably to the taste of peanuts than BPs (0 types), more volatile substances (40 types) than BPs (12 types), and a higher number of key volatile aroma components (8 types) than BPs (3 types). That is, roasting induced a relatively small effect on nutritional components and gave peanuts a richer taste and stronger aroma than boiling; therefore, roasting is an ideal peanut processing method. This study proved the different changes in peanuts caused by boiling and roasting on a material basis and corroborated the irreplaceability of roasting in peanut processing.']",public,['12(11):9314-9324'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFlpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Ying'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Wmh1LCBXZWljaGFv', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Weichao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SmluLCBZdWFuYmFv', 'prefLabel': 'Jin, Yuanbao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WHUsIEppeXVhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Xu, Jiyuan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhvdSwgV2VubG9uZw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhou, Wenlong'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2hlbiwgVGluZ3Rpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Shen, Tingting'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgQW5zaHU=', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Anshu'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5988-3643', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Zhihua'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgSG9uZ2Jpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Hongbing'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['Effect of Boiling and Roasting Treatments on the Nutrients, Lipid Quality, and Flavor of Peanuts']",2025-04-24T13:06:26.016+0200,286.0

Data were obtained retrospectively from the National Medical Birth Register, child health centres and school health services. Anthropometric data and parental reported food habits were collected in the 2007–2008 IDEFICS baseline survey. Follow-up data for 656 children were collected in the 2013–2014 I. Family survey.

frl:6511103,"['The combinatorial phosphorylation of myo-inositol results in the generation of different inositol phosphates (InsPs), of which phytic acid (InsP6) is the most abundant species in eukaryotes. InsP6 is also an important precursor of the higher phosphorylated inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), such as InsP7 and InsP8, which are characterized by a diphosphate moiety and are also ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells. While PP-InsPs regulate various cellular processes in animals and yeast, their biosynthesis and functions in plants has remained largely elusive because plant genomes do not encode canonical InsP6 kinases. Recent work has shown that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) INOSITOL (1,3,4) TRIPHOSPHATE 5/6 KINASE1 (ITPK1) and ITPK2 display in vitro InsP6 kinase activity and that, in planta, ITPK1 stimulates 5-InsP7 and InsP8 synthesis and regulates phosphate starvation responses. Here we report a critical role of ITPK1 in auxin-related processes that is independent of the ITPK1-controlled regulation of phosphate starvation responses. Those processes include primary root elongation, root hair development, leaf venation, thermomorphogenic and gravitropic responses, and sensitivity to exogenously applied auxin. We found that the recombinant auxin receptor complex, consisting of the F-Box protein TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 (TIR1), ARABIDOPSIS SKP1 HOMOLOGUE 1 (ASK1) and the transcriptional repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 7 (IAA7), binds to anionic inositol polyphosphates with high affinity. We further identified a physical interaction between ITPK1 and TIR1, suggesting a localized production of 5-InsP7, or another ITPK1-dependent InsP/PP-InsP isomer, to activate the auxin receptor complex. Finally, we demonstrate that ITPK1 and ITPK2 function redundantly to control auxin responses, as deduced from the auxin-insensitive phenotypes of itpk1 itpk2 double mutant plants. Our findings expand the mechanistic understanding of auxin perception and suggest that distinct inositol polyphosphates generated near auxin receptors help to fine-tune auxin sensitivity in plants.']",public,['190(4):2722-2738'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7744-1408', 'prefLabel': 'Laha, Nargis Parvin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1006-3163', 'prefLabel': 'Hettwer Giehl, Ricardo Fabiano'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UmllbWVyLCBFc3RoZXI=', 'prefLabel': 'Riemer, Esther'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2197-3218', 'prefLabel': 'Qiu, Danye'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7285-6068', 'prefLabel': 'Pullagurla, Naga Jyothi'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9657-4548', 'prefLabel': 'Schneider, Robin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0796-0050', 'prefLabel': 'Walia Dhir, Yashika'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4956-5638', 'prefLabel': 'Yadav, Ranjana'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2059-880X', 'prefLabel': 'Mihiret, Yeshambel Emewodih'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9187-404X', 'prefLabel': 'Gaugler, Philipp'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3249-2922', 'prefLabel': 'Gaugler, Verena'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFvLCBIYWliaW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Mao, Haibin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1039-1581', 'prefLabel': 'Zheng, Ning'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-425X', 'prefLabel': 'von Wirén, Nicolaus'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4351-0081', 'prefLabel': 'Saiardi, Adolfo'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1369-7700', 'prefLabel': 'BHATTACHARJEE, SAIKAT'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1025-9484', 'prefLabel': 'Jessen, Henning'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFoYSwgRGViYWJyYXRh', 'prefLabel': 'Laha, Debabrata'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9022-4515', 'prefLabel': 'Schaaf, Gabriel'}]",2022.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]","['INOSITOL (1,3,4) TRIPHOSPHATE 5/6 KINASE1-dependent inositol polyphosphates regulate auxin responses in Arabidopsis']",2025-04-16T14:45:15.952+0200,325.0

To elucidate the linkages between juvenile green turtles foraging in coastal waters of Uruguay in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean to their future nesting or feeding grounds, this study investigated their genetic composition . A total of 201 tissue samples were collected from turtles that had stranded or were intentionally captured for scientific research along the Uruguayan coast (ca. 33°–35°S) during two sampling periods (2003–2005 and 2009–2014). Samples were pooled for analysis. Twelve mitochondrial control region haplotypes and ten subhaplotypes were identified, all of which had been previously detected at Atlantic or Caribbean nesting beaches. Mixed Stock Analysis revealed that most turtles traced to the Ascension Island rookery, representing a substantial connection to the remote mid-Atlantic island thousands of kilometers distant. Other nesting areas, such as Guinea Bissau in Africa and Trindade Island in Brazil, represented less significant sources. There was no significant temporal or spatial genetic structure within Uruguayan waters, suggesting dispersion along this coast. Despite the geographic distance from the nesting beach, the significant connection to the Ascension Island rookery underscores the importance of considering rookery population size and ocean current influences in understanding source contributions.

We conducted a cross-sectional study including 40 transgender women (sample size based on prior calculation), and age- and body mass index-matched cisgender women (n\u2009=\u200925) and cisgender men (n\u2009=\u200925) as controls. Blood samples were collected between 2016 and 2023. We assessed hemostatic parameters (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], free protein S, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, antithrombin, anticoagulant protein C, prothrombin time activity, thrombin time), hormonal profile (estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, estrogen dose, total testosterone, and free androgen index), and inflammatory markers (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and leukocyte count). Transgender women (mean [SD] age, 30.6 [8.0] years; median GAHT duration, 36.5 months) and cisgender women had similar hemostatic and inflammatory parameters. Compared with cisgender men, transgender women had higher PAI-1 levels (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and lower free protein S levels (p\u2009=\u20090.023). No differences were found in other hemostatic parameters between the groups. In conclusion, transgender women on long-term GAHT had higher levels of PAI-1 and lower levels of free protein S than cisgender men, indicating a slightly more prothrombotic profile. However, their hemostatic and inflammatory parameters were similar to those of cisgender women, suggesting a shift towards a female pattern.

Therefore, this study evaluated a novel intervention\r\napproach by testing the effectiveness of two online interventions based on\r\nthe study demands-resources framework. These interventions aimed to\r\nbalance demands and resources. Derived from the theoretical assumptions of\r\nthe framework, we hypothesized that the interventions would increase study\r\nand personal resources, engagement, and study crafting, and decrease study\r\ndemands, exhaustion, and self-undermining. Additionally, we hypothesized\r\nthat demands and resources would mediate the effects of the intervention on\r\nengagement, exhaustion, study crafting, and self-undermining.\r\nMETHODS: Conducted as a randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control\r\ngroup (n = 71), the study involved participants in two intervention groups who\r\nengaged with the interventions for 2 weeks. Intervention group 1 (n = 64)\r\nfocused on adapting demands, while intervention group 2 (n = 70) focused on\r\nincreasing resources. The design allowed for a comparison of the effectiveness\r\nof these different approaches. Participants completed questionnaires before\r\nand after the intervention, and at a 5-week follow-up.\r\nRESULTS: Results of the analyses of variance with repeated measures revealed\r\nthat the interventions had significant positive effects on the personal resource\r\nmindfulness, two study crafting strategies, self-undermining, and exhaustion.\r\nNotably, intervention group 2 exhibited more positive outcomes.

This research investigates the potential of silymarin-supplemented cookies in managing NAFLD by evaluating their impact on liver enzyme activity, inflammatory markers, and lipid profiles. A clinical trial in Lahore, Pakistan, involved 64 NAFLD patients. Participants were divided into placebo and three treatment groups, with the latter receiving silymarin-supplemented cookies for 3 months. The study assessed liver enzyme levels and inflammatory markers, at baseline and after the intervention, utilizing statistical analyses to evaluate differences. The lipid profile and renal function test (RFT) were also measured at baseline and after 3\u2009months in each group for safety assessment. After 3 months, the treatment groups indicated more significant decreases in liver enzymes compared to the placebo group (p\u2009≤\u2009.05). Treatment 3 showed significant reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (64.39–49.38\u2009U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (61.53–45.38\u2009U/L). Treatment 3 also showed improvements in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and the AST/ALT ratio. Additionally, the treatment group demonstrated a significant reduction in inflammatory markers. Treatment 3 showed a significant decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) (6.32–3.39\u2009mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (38.72–23.86\u2009mm/h), indicating that individuals with NAFLD may benefit from the intervention's potential benefits in lowering inflammation.

Yet, the effectiveness and safety of currently available therapies for psoriasis would benefit from further improvement. Efforts to identify novel pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis will further improve the understanding of the disease etiology and form the basis for innovative treatments that could modulate psoriasis therapy outcomes. Psoriasis is thought to be caused by both genetics and environmental factors. Many genetic studies have been conducted, and several candidate genes have been proposed: e.g., HLA locus and various immune system-related genes. In contrast, very few studies focusing on the risk association of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants have been performed in psoriasis. One association study in the UK suggests a potential link between mtDNA variants in the mitochondrial complex III gene (Cytochrome b gene) and the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the variants in the mitochondrial genome in the mitochondrial complex III contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Our data showed a very mild impact of the mtDNA-encoded complex III gene variant on psoriasis and immune cell phenotypes (cellular function and mitochondrial functions). The initial investigations in this project did not yield sufficiently strong phenotypical effects. However, we expanded our investigation and explored the effects of respiratory chain deficiency in keratinocytes. When a nuclear genome encoded complex III gene was deleted in basal keratinocytes of adult mice, mice exhibited spontaneous, severe skin lesions, which mimic the clinical presentation of psoriasis. The current findings build on the proposed mechanisms of this project and suggest that a genetic deficiency in complex III of the respiratory chain results in spontaneous, psoriasis-like skin inflammation and would constitute a novel model to study the disease in mice. We plan to continue the characterization of these spontaneously developing skin lesions.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Schilf, Paul', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1363814532'}, {'prefLabel': 'Ibrahim, Saleh M.', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Ibrahim, Saleh M.'}, {'prefLabel': 'Universität zu Lübeck.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents a well-established biomarker of PCa, and its levels correlate positively with the disease progression, culminating at the stage of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Due to its tissue-specific expression and cell surface localization, PSMA shows superior potential for precise imaging and therapy of PCa. Antibody-based immunotherapy targeting PSMA offers the promise of selectively engaging the host immune system with minimal off-target effects. Here we report on the design, expression, purification, and characterization of a bispecific engager, termed 5D3-CP33, that efficiently recruits macrophages to the vicinity of PSMA-positive cancer cells mediating PCa death. The engager was engineered by fusing the anti-PSMA 5D3 antibody fragment to a cyclic peptide 33 (CP33), selectively binding the Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI/CD64) on the surface of phagocytes. Functional parts of the 5D3-CP33 engager revealed a nanomolar affinity for PSMA and FcγRI/CD64 with dissociation constants of KD =\u2009 3\u2009nM and KD =\u2009 140\u2009nM, respectively. At a concentration as low as 0.3\u2009nM, the engager was found to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species by U937 monocytic cells in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis of PSMA-positive cancer cells by U937 monocytes when exposed to 0.15\u2009nM 5D3-CP33. Our findings illustrate that 5D3-CP33 effectively and specifically activates monocytes upon PSMA-positive target engagement, resulting in the elimination of tumor cells. The 5D3-CP33 engager can thus serve as a promising lead for developing new immunotherapy tools for the efficient treatment of PCa.']",public,['20(3):e0307353'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGFzLCBHYXJnaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Das, Gargi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UHRhY2VrLCBKYWt1Yg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ptacek, Jakub'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2FtcGJlbGwsIEphbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Campbell, Jana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFhpbnRhbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Xintang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGF2bGlub3ZhLCBCYXJib3Jh', 'prefLabel': 'Havlinova, Barbora'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tm9vbmVwYWxsZSwgU2F0aXNoIGt1bWFy', 'prefLabel': 'Noonepalle, Satish kumar'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9346-8355', 'prefLabel': 'Villagra, Alejandro'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmFyaW5rYSwgQ3lyaWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Barinka, Cyril'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9804-6346', 'prefLabel': 'Novakova, Zora'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Targeting prostate cancer by new bispecific monocyte engager directed to prostate-specific membrane antigen'],2025-03-19T13:58:23.444+0100,337.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and related direct medical costs of patients in France treated with weekly conventional SCIg (cSCIg) vs monthly hyaluronidase-facilitated SCIg (fSCIg). METHODS: This retrospective study of Ig-naïve patients with PID or SID newly receiving a SCIg between 2016 and 2018, extracted from the French National Healthcare reimbursement database (SNDS), analyzed the SCIg-related HCRU and reimbursed costs generated from in-hospital (hospitalizations and SCIg doses) or at-home (nurse visits [NV] and pump provider visits [PPV], drug doses) SCIg administration. RESULTS: Overall, 2,012 patients (PID:534; SID:1,478) were analyzed. The follow-up duration varied between 7.5 and 8.7 months according to sub-groups. Compared with fSCIg-treated patients, monthly mean rates of NV and PPV were respectively 2.5 and 3.1 times higher in PID, and 1.6 and 3.1 times higher in SID cSCIg-treated patients. Monthly mean rates for SCIg administration-related hospitalizations were lower overall, while their costs were 1.6 and 1.8 times higher for cSCIg than fSCIg subgroups, in PIDs and SIDs respectively; these results are due to more frequent hospitalizations with fSCIg being mainly shorter, without stayover. Total HCRU costs from the French NHI’s perspective were estimated to be lower with fSCIg vs cSCIg, in PIDs and SIDs. CONCLUSION: This study provides real-world evidence of SCIg administration in a large French population. Patients with PID or SID treated with fSCIg had fewer at-home HCRU and lower overall costs for in-hospital or at-home SCIg administration compared with cSCIg-treated patients.\r\n']",public,['20(1):e0313694'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVmw6h2cmUsIEd1aWxsYXVtZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Lefèvre, Guillaume'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Qm9yZ2V0LCBJc2FiZWxsZQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Borget, Isabelle'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0005-5127-2617', 'prefLabel': 'LEFEVRE, Cinira Cécile'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFoZXJ6aSwgQ2hhaHJhemVk', 'prefLabel': 'Maherzi, Chahrazed'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TnVjaXQsIEFybmF1ZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Nucit, Arnaud'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVubmFvdWksIE1vdW5h', 'prefLabel': 'Hennaoui, Mouna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2NobWlkdCwgQXVyw6lsaWU=', 'prefLabel': 'Schmidt, Aurélie'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGVubm9uLCBIYW5uYWg=', 'prefLabel': 'Lennon, Hannah'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2373-1872', 'prefLabel': 'Grenier, Benjamin'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9805-5864', 'prefLabel': 'Daydé, Florent'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFobGFvdWksIE5pemFy', 'prefLabel': 'Mahlaoui, Nizar'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Healthcare resource utilization and costs in immunodeficient patients receiving subcutaneous Ig: Real-world evidence from France'],2025-03-18T15:06:48.553+0100,337.0

A major obstacle to understanding myelination is the challenge of visualizing and reproducibly quantifying this inherently three-dimensional process in vitro. To this end, we previously developed artificial axons (AAs), a biocompatible platform consisting of 3D-printed hydrogel-based axon mimics designed to more closely recapitulate the micrometer-scale diameter and sub-kilopascal mechanical stiffness of biological axons. First, we present our platform for fabricating AAs with tunable axon diameter, stiffness, and inter-axonal spacing. Second, we demonstrate that increasing the Young’s modulus E or stiffness of polymer comprising the AAs increases the extent of myelin ensheathment by rat oligodendrocytes. Third, we demonstrate that the responses of oligodendrocytes to pro-myelinating compounds are also dependent on axon stiffness, which can affect compounds efficacy and the relative ranking. These results reinforce the importance of studying myelination in mechanically representative environments, and highlight the importance of considering biophysical cues when conducting drug screening studies.']",public,['20(1):e0290521'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2558-7074', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Mingyu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWFydGluLCBDYWxsaW9wZSBKLiBMLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Martin, Calliope J.

Randomized controlled trials involving pediatric patients (<18 years old) published in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to October 27, 2024 were searched and screened. RevMan software was utilized for quality assessment, and  meta-analysis was performed using R version 4.4.1. Efficacy measures included the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), the Numeric Rating Scale for Itch (NRS), and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). The results of these measures were expressed as odds ratios (OR), while treatment rankings of different interventions were determined using the P-score. RESULT: This study included 11 trials involving 7 agents and 2,352 pediatric patients. The results indicated that dupilumab (300\u2009mg) showed better outcomes than placebo in IGA-0/1 (OR =\u2009 4.68, 95% CI: 2.53–8.63), NRS-4 (OR =\u2009 6.75, 95% CI: 3.85–11.86), and all EASI outcomes. Tralokinumab may be the most effective option for alleviating pruritus (P-score for NRS-4, 0.8447). Upadacitinib (30\u2009mg) performed best in IGA-0/1 (P-score, 0.9414), EASI-90 (P-score, 0.9926), and EASI-75 (P-score, 0.9707). Dupilumab (300\u2009mg) had a higher risk of nasopharyngitis compared to placebo (OR\u2009=\u20092.15, 95%CI: 1.04–4.43). Compared to both placebo and dupilumab (300\u2009mg), adverse event rates were higher with upadacitinib (15\u2009mg and 30\u2009mg), and upper respiratory tract infection risk was elevated with baricitinib (2\u2009mg and 4\u2009mg) and tralokinumab (300\u2009mg). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of dupilumab for pediatric AD remains substantial, while other agents including upadacitinib, delgocitinib, and tralokinumab also present certain advantages. Future clinical trials may necessitate further evaluation of safety concerns.\r\n']",public,['20(2):e0319400'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0007-0803-5426', 'prefLabel': 'Liao, Qiwei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFuLCBIYW53ZW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Pan, Hanwen'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3VvLCBZaXhpbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Guo, Yixin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGFuLCBZdXhpYW5n', 'prefLabel': 'Lan, Yuxiang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHVhbmcsIFpodW8=', 'prefLabel': 'Huang, Zhuo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFBlaXlp', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Peiyi'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Comparative efficacy and safety of dupilumab versus newly approved biologics and JAKi in pediatric atopic dermatitis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis'],2025-03-14T11:43:42.378+0100,337.0

However, it is unclear whether patterns of circulating bile acids (BAs) change in patients with benign GBDs such as gallbladder stones and polyps. Herein, we compared and characterised plasma BA profiles in patients with cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps with healthy controls, and explored relationships between plasma BA profiles, demographics, and laboratory test indices. METHODS: A total of 330 subjects (13 healthy controls, 292 cholecystolithiasis and 25 non-neoplastic polyps) were recruited and plasma BA profiles including 14 metabolites from patients with pathologically confirmed cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were compared with controls. BAs were quantitated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and statistical and regression analyses of demographics and laboratory test indices were performed. RESULTS: Females displayed a higher burden of GBD than males (63.36% cholecystolithiasis, 60% non-neoplastic polyps). Cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were associated with increased plasma total secondary BAs, while levels of primary BAs were lower than in healthy controls. Plasma ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), glycyurdeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were decreased significantly in GBDs, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was negatively correlated with white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary BA levels were higher in patients with cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps.

We hypothesized that in critically-ill patients with SCD receiving cefotaxime during acute chest syndrome, the continuous infusion may outperform the intermittent administration in achieving pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets. DESIGN: Prospective before-after study. SETTINGS: Intensive-care unit of a French teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral center. PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive episodes of severe acute chest syndrome in 58 adult patients with sickle cell disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with intermittent administration during the first period (April 2016 –April 2018) and with continuous infusion during the second period (May 2018 –August 2019). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 episodes of acute chest syndrome in 58 patients (29 [25–34] years, 37/58 (64%) males). Daily dose of cefotaxime was similar between groups (59 [48–88] vs. 61 [57–64] mg/kg/day, p = 0.84). Most patients (>75%) presented a glomerular hyperfiltration with no difference between groups (p = 0.25). More patients had a cefotaxime trough level ≥2 mg/L with continuous infusion than intermittent administration: 28 (93%) vs. 5 (16%), p<0.001. The median residual concentration was higher in the continuous infusion than intermittent administration group: 10.5 [7.4–13.3] vs. 0 [0–0] mg/L, p<0.001. No infection relapse was observed in the entire cohort. Hospital length of stay was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: As compared to intermittent administration, continuous infusion of cefotaxime maximizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in patients with SCD.

To a certain extent, there is a lag in using wet-lab experiments to test the immunogenicity in the development process of antibody therapeutics. Developing a computational method to predict the immunogenicity at once the antibody sequence is designed, is of great significance for the screening in the early stage and reducing the risk of antibody therapeutics development. In this study, a computational immunogenicity prediction method was proposed on the basis of AntiBERTy-based features of amino sequences in the antibody variable region. The AntiBERTy-based sequence features were first calculated using the AntiBERTy pre-trained model. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then applied to reduce the extracted feature to two dimensions to obtain the final features. AutoGluon was then used to train multiple machine learning models and the best one, the weighted ensemble model, was obtained through 5-fold cross-validation on the collected data. The data contains 199 commercial therapeutic antibodies, of which 177 samples were used for model training and 5-fold cross-validation, and the remaining 22 samples were used as an independent test dataset to evaluate the performance of the constructed model and compare it with other prediction methods. Test results show that the proposed method outperforms the comparison method with 0.7273 accuracy on the independent test dataset, which is 9.09% higher than the comparison method.

In the current study, potato starch–pectin (PSP) composite films were fabricated and enriched with juniper berry essential oil (JBEO) to improve their physicochemical properties. The effects of incorporating different concentrations of JBEO (0.1%–1% v/v) on various properties of PSP-based films were evaluated, including surface color, transparency, barrier properties, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA and DTA), antioxidant activity, and antimicrobial effectiveness. Increasing the level of JBEO led to a significant decrease in the moisture content, film transparency, and mechanical attributes, while an increase in thickness, water permeability, and film elongation was observed. SEM analysis also revealed morphological properties such as some spherical, bubble-like configuration and cracks on the surface due to an increase in JBEO concentration. TGA and DTA revealed lower weight loss in the initial cycles due to the addition of JBEO, and the thermal stability of the films improved. The antioxidant assays revealed a concentration-dependent increase in the radical scavenging capacity of the films from 11.31% to 17.28% for DPPH and from 3.06% to 25.53% for ABTS. Moreover, significant antibacterial and antifungal activity of the bioactive films was observed against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and C. albicans.

frl:6526190,"[""Creatine (Cr) is recognized for its role in enhancing cognitive functions through the phosphocreatine (pCr)–creatine kinase system involved in brain energy homeostasis. It is reversibly converted into pCr by creatine kinase (CK). A brain-specific isoform of CK, known as CK-BB, is implicated in the brain's energy metabolism. The objective of this research is to ascertain the impact of Cr supplementation on learning and memory skills as well as on structural synaptic plasticity, by modulating CK-BB. First, we utilized various concentrations of D-galactose (D-gal) to create an aging mouse model. Our findings indicated that D-gal injections at 100 and 1000\u2009mg/kg could lead to cognitive decline, oxidative stress, and damage to structural synaptic plasticity. CK-BB expression and its activity were reduced at least by approximately 20% in mice injected with 100 and 1000\u2009mg/kg D-gal compared with control group. Next, an adeno-associated virus directed against CKB was employed to reduce CK-BB levels by 34% in the brain. The reduction of CK-BB in the brain resulted in deficits in learning and memory, oxidative stress, and morphological harm to the hippocampal spines of mice. Finally, the diet of the D-gal-induced aging model was enriched with 3% Cr. Mice that received 3% Cr supplementation exhibited a 36% increase in CK-BB activity and a 14.3% increase in CK-BB expression following prolonged D-gal administration. In addition, Cr supplementation mitigated the cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and hippocampal structural plasticity damage caused by chronic D-gal injections. Overall, our study revealed that CK-BB has a critical role in mediating structural plasticity in D-gal-induced cognitive impairment. Moreover, it showed that supplementary Cr could serve as a potent neuroprotective substance, preventing or delaying the course of age-related cognitive deficits.""]",public,['13(1):e4767'],"[{'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1022-7113', 'prefLabel': 'Zhu, Zhu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIEhhbnRhbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Hantao'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TGksIFFpYW5saW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Li, Qianlin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuLCBYdQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Han, Xu'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V2FuZywgVGlhbnRpYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Wang, Tiantian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbmcsIFdlbmppbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhang, Wenjing'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgRmVpeWFu', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Feiyan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3UsIExpbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Gu, Ling'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFvLCBRaQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Yao, Qi'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q2hlbiwgTGlu', 'prefLabel': 'Chen, Lin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WmhhbywgWXVuYW4=', 'prefLabel': 'Zhao, Yunan'}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Long-Term Creatine Supplementation Improves Cognitive and Hippocampal Structural Plasticity Impairments in a D-Gal-Induced Aging Model via Increasing CK-BB Activity in the Brain'],2025-09-16T11:14:32.978+0200,286.0

Despite advancements in current HCC treatment, it remains a malignancy with poor prognosis. Therefore, developing novel treatment options for patients with HCC is urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells have demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects, making them as a promising immunotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Glypican-3 (GPC3), a cell surface oncofetal glycoprotein, is highly expressed in most HCC tissues, but not in normal tissues, and functions as a key driver of carcinogenesis. Given its high expression level on the cell surface, GPC3 is considered as an attractive immunotherapy target for HCC. In this study, two GPC3-specific CAR-NK cells, NK92MI/HN3 and NK92MI/HS20, were established using NK92MI cells, a modified IL-2-independent NK cell line. These cell lines were engineered with third generation GPC3-specific CARs, and their activities were subsequently evaluated in the treatment of HCC. We found that NK92MI/HN3 cells, rather than NK92MI/HS20 cells, exhibited a significant cytotoxicity effect against GPC3+ HepG2 cells in vitro and efficiently suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft model using NSG mice. In addition, irradiated NK92MI/HN3 cells displayed similar anti-tumor efficacy to unirradiated NK92MI/HN3 cells. Furthermore, we observed that NK92MI/HN3 cells showed higher killing activity against the GPC3 isoform 2 overexpression cell line (Sk-Hep1-v2) than those with GPC3 isoform 1 overexpression cell line (Sk-Hep1-v1). This suggest that the presence of different GPC3 isoforms in HCC may impact the cytotoxicity activity of NK92MI/HN3 cells and potentially influence therapeutic outcomes. These findings highlight the effective anti-HCC effects of NK92MI/HN3 cells and reveal the role of GPC3 isoforms in influencing therapy outcomes, suggesting that isoform analysis should be considered to optimize CAR-NK therapies to improve patient outcomes.']",public,['20(1):e0317401'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WWFuZywgTGVp', 'prefLabel': 'Yang, Lei'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGhhbSwgS2llbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Pham, Kien'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/WGksIFlpYm8=', 'prefLabel': 'Xi, Yibo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/V3UsIFF1bmZlbmc=', 'prefLabel': 'Wu, Qunfeng'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7295-8088', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Dongfang'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Um9iZXJ0c29uLCBLZWl0aCBELg==', 'prefLabel': 'Robertson, Keith D.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-0430-6146', 'prefLabel': 'Liu, Chen '}]",2025.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Exploring Glypican-3 targeted CAR-NK treatment and potential therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma'],2025-03-20T13:41:36.353+0100,337.0

METHODS: A microarray dataset of AR patients and normal controls (GSE43523) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for differential gene analysis. Cuproptosis related genes were extracted from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to form the AR/cuprotosis-gene set and analyzed by the GO and KEGG databases. Intersection analysis further defined the AR signature genes (AR-sg). Consensus cluster analyses were used to define the AR/cuprotosis-genes into subsets. Finally, AR signature genes were used as targets for drug prediction and molecular docking to identify candidate drugs that may affect SAR. RESULTS: Four AR signature genes (MRPS30, CLPX, MRPL13, and MRPL53) were selected by the MCC, EPC, BottleNeck, and Closeness algorithms. Correlation analysis of the AR signature genes and immune genes showed strong interactions; xCell analysis identified multiple immune cell types and supported these cells’ importance in the AR pathogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with active ulcerative colitis treated with ustekinumab at Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital from June 2020 to January 2023. We divided patients into non-remission and remission groups, and examined whether baseline biomarkers, including C-reactive protein-to-lymphocyte ratio, and early treatment response could predict clinical remission at week 48 of ustekinumab treatment. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients included in the study, 21 (63.6%) were in clinical remission at week 48 of ustekinumab treatment. Baseline C-reactive protein-to-lymphocyte ratio values were significantly higher in the non-remission than in the remission group.

In this session, Dr. Jon Salmanton-García explores the critical role of clinical trials in developing new antifungal therapies. He explains the fundamentals of antifungal clinical research, guiding viewers through each stage of drug development—from preclinical studies to Phase I–III trials. Key topics include trial design, patient populations, clinical endpoints, and the unique challenges in evaluating antifungal efficacy and safety. Dr. Salmanton-García also emphasizes the importance of addressing unmet medical needs, particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those in hematology. The lecture highlights recent advancements and future directions in antifungal treatment, focusing on novel agents, innovative strategies, and the ongoing fight against antifungal resistance—all with the goal of improving clinical outcomes.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Salmanton-García, Jon', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1198897716'}, {'prefLabel': 'Salmanton-García, Jon', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1198897716'}, {'prefLabel': 'Universitätsklinikum Köln.

Um dies zu untersuchen, haben wir ein kontrollierten Mutantenpool entworfen, um die metabolischen Fähigkeiten dieses Pathogens zu erforschen. Mithilfe von WISH-Barcoding haben wir 35 metabolische Mutanten in fünf verschiedenen Mausmodellen getestet, was uns ermöglichte, zwischen kontextabhängigen und kontextunabhängigen Nährstoffquellen zu unterscheiden. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass S. Typhimurium D-Glucose, D-Mannose, D-Fructose und D-Galactose als kontextunabhängige Kohlenhydrate in allen Modellen nutzt. Die Nutzung von N-Acetylglucosamin und Hexuronaten war dagegen kontextabhängig. Darüber hinaus haben wir gezeigt, dass D-Fructose wichtig für den Konkurrenzkampf zwischen Salmonella-Serovaren ist. Ergänzende Experimente bestätigten, dass D-Glucose, D-Fructose und D-Galactose ausgezeichnete Nischen für S. Typhimurium während der Besiedlung darstellen. Quantitative Messungen ergaben ausreichende Mengen an D-Glucose und D-Galactose im murinen Zökum, um die Besiedlung von S. Typhimurium zu unterstützen.

Volunteer retention and recruitment represents a threat to the existence for 17.5% of clubs. The decline in the number of young volunteers is particularly problematic. Although the number of coaches and trainers remains stable, it comes against the backdrop of a rising number of members, which is likely to increase the workload of existing staff.

Allerdings ist zu berücksichtigen, dass es in Deutschland – im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen europäischen Ländern – während der ersten beiden Jahre der Coronavirus-Pandemie zu keinem Rückgang der Organspende gekommen war. Diese antizyklische Entwicklung ist nicht auf einen einzigen Faktor zurückzuführen.

Using pharmacological approaches (Roxa treatment), the project has yielded several important findings. Roxa not only increased systemic erythropoiesis but also expanded a renal Sca-1⁺ mesenchymal stem-like cell population with temporary EPO-producing capacity and immunomodulatory properties, highlighting the heterogeneity of the renal interstitium. Additionally, conditionally immortalized REP-derived cells (REPD) demonstrated remarkable plasticity, with pericytic and neuroglial features, and exhibited a switch-like induction of EPO under hypoxia, confirming the unique regulation of EPO expression. REPD cells also formed tunneling nanotubes, suggesting structural and functional integration into the vascular niche.

The SMAS index was constructed using baseline structural MRI data from the DELCODE study and evaluated longitudinally in two independent cohorts: DELCODE (n=415) and ADNI (n=190). Our findings indicate that SMAS has strong associations with cognitive performance (DELCODE: r=-0.83; ADNI: r=-0.62), age (DELCODE: r=0.50; ADNI: r=0.28), hippocampal volume (DELCODE: r=-0.44; ADNI: r=-0.66), and total gray matter volume (DELCODE: r=-0.42; ADNI: r=-0.47), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for AD-related brain atrophy. Moreover, our longitudinal studies indicated that SMAS may be useful for the early identification and tracking of AD. The model demonstrated significant predictive accuracy in distinguishing cognitively healthy individuals from those with AD (DELCODE: AUC=0.971 at baseline, 0.833 at 36 months; ADNI: AUC=0.817 at baseline, improving to 0.903 at 24 months). Notably, over 36 months, the SMAS index outperformed existing measures such as SPARE-AD and hippocampal volume. The relevance map analysis revealed significant morphological changes in key AD-related brain regions, including the hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal cortex, highlighting that SMAS is a sensitive and interpretable biomarker of brain atrophy, suitable for early AD detection and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression.

frl:6526157,"['Neuromodulators control mood, arousal, and behavior by inducing synaptic plasticity via G-protein-coupled receptors. While long-term presynaptic potentiation requires structural changes, mechanisms enabling potentiation within minutes remain unclear. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, we show that octopamine, the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, potentiates evoked neurotransmitter release on the timescale of one minute via a G-protein-coupled pathway involving presynaptic OAMB receptors and phospholipase C. This fast potentiation correlates with elevated signals of the release factor Unc13A and the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot. Live, single-molecule imaging of endogenously tagged Unc13 revealed its instantly reduced motility and increased concentration in synaptic nanoclusters with potentiation. Presynaptic knockdown of Unc13A fully blocked fast potentiation. Moreover, deleting its N-terminal localization sequence mislocalized the protein fragment to the cytosol, but still allowed for rapid plasma membrane recruitment by diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol esters and octopamine, implicating a role of more C-terminal domains. A point mutation of endogenous Unc13 in its DAG-binding C1 domain blocked plasticity-induced nanoscopic enrichment and synaptic potentiation. The mutation increased basal neurotransmission but reduced Unc13 levels, revealing a gain of function and potential homeostatic compensation. The mutation also blocked phorbol ester-induced potentiation, decreased the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmission, and caused short-term synaptic depression. Homeostatic potentiation induced by postsynaptic receptor block mirrored octopamine-induced Unc13 recruitment and required presynaptic OAMB receptors, indicating overlapping machinery.

While excitatory neurons have been considered necessary for tonotopy in the cortex, the role of inhibitory interneurons remains unclear. Using a novel two-channel widefield Ca2+ imaging system, the 2-Channel Alternating exposure wide-Field Explorer (2-CAFE), we simultaneously measured the sound responsiveness of distinct neuron types in awake mice. Combined with two-photon imaging, we observed that GABAergic interneurons followed a similar tonotopic organization to the conventional auditory maps at both mesoscale and single-cell resolutions. Among the major interneuron subtypes-parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-PV interneurons demonstrated a critical role in maintaining tonotopy. Inactivation of PV neurons, but not VIP or SST neurons, significantly weakened the tonotopic strength in the auditory cortex.

This predictability plays a role in action selection, initiation, and the evaluation of action outcomes, and should therefore influence neural processing both before and after movement. Here, we examined the effect of sensory predictability on pre- and post-movement processing, as reflected in two signals in the human electroencephalogram (EEG): theReadiness Potential(RP) and thepost-movement beta rebound(PMBR). Thirty-six participants performed self-paced button presses in three conditions, in which they received either highly predictable auditory feedback (always the same sound), weakly predictable auditory feedback (an unpredictable, pseudo-random sound), or no auditory feedback. In the former two conditions, 20% of button presses unexpectedly elicited no sound. In these omission trials, we observed brain responses, which indicated that participants formed sensory predictions of a varying level of detail. Crucially, RP amplitude was increased when button presses always produced the same sound, compared to pseudo-random sounds, or no sound, with the latter two conditions showing no difference. In contrast, the PMBR was unchanged across conditions. Our results indicate that the specificity of sensory prediction influences the pre-movement processes reflected in the RP, even when these details are not task-relevant.

Ripples, identified in MEG sensors covering the medial temporal lobe (MTL) region, predicted individual WM performance. Ripples were locked to robust oscillatory patterns in the EEG defined spindle band. Wake spindle activity and ripples decrease during initial stimulus presentation and rebound after 1 sec. Behaviorally, PA enhanced WM performance. Neurophysiologically, PA scaled the ripple rate with the number of items to be kept in WM and strengthened the coupling between ripple events and wake spindle events.

Here we identify major transcriptional networks deregulated in DFUs that result in decreased neutrophils and macrophages recruitment and overall poorly controlled inflammatory response. Transcription factors FOXM1 and STAT3, which function to activate and promote survival of immune cells, are inhibited in DFUs. Moreover, inhibition of FOXM1 in diabetic mouse models (STZ-induced and db/db) results in delayed wound healing and decreased neutrophil and macrophage recruitment in diabetic wounds in vivo. Our data underscore the role of a perturbed, ineffective inflammatory response as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of DFUs, which is facilitated by FOXM1-mediated deregulation of recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, revealing a potential therapeutic strategy.']",public,['11(1)'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2F3YXlhLCBBbmRyZXcgUC4=', 'prefLabel': 'Sawaya, Andrew P.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RvbmUsIFJpdmthIEMu', 'prefLabel': 'Stone, Rivka C.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QnJvb2tzLCBTdGVwaGVuIFIu', 'prefLabel': 'Brooks, Stephen R.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0197-6198', 'prefLabel': 'Pastar, Irena'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5114-9524', 'prefLabel': 'Jozic, Ivan'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFzbmVlbiwgS293c2Vy', 'prefLabel': 'Hasneen, Kowser'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T_KAmU5laWxsLCBLYXRlbHlu', 'prefLabel': 'O�Neill, Katelyn'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4805-4262', 'prefLabel': 'Mehdizadeh, Spencer'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGVhZCwgQ2hleWFubmUgUi4=', 'prefLabel': 'Head, Cheyanne R.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3RyYm8sIE5hdGFzYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Strbo, Natasa'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9632-9593', 'prefLabel': 'Morasso, Maria I.'}, {'@id': 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9341-0193', 'prefLabel': 'Tomic-Canic, Marjana'}]",2020.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['Deregulated immune cell recruitment orchestrated by FOXM1 impairs human diabetic wound healing'],2025-02-19T14:56:24.156+0100,337.0

The results from previous analyses have been limited by small sample sizes and different treatment regimens. METHODS: Patients with stage IV SBA were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program (SEER) database. Cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank test. Multiple logistic and Cox regression identified covariates associated with treatment options and survival. RESULTS: 1219 eligible patients were involved in this study. The median age was 67 (range, 20-95) with 655 (53.7%) males and 564 (46.3%) females. Age and primary tumor site were significantly associated with surgery performance, age was also significantly associated with chemotherapy (P < .01). To reduce bias, further six subgroups were divided by age (≤65 and >65) and primary tumor site (duodenum, jejunum and ileum). Chemotherapy and surgery conferred a benefit on survival of the whole cohort (the median CSS of different treatment groups were 17, 9, 4, and 1 month respectively, P < .001) and most subgroups (83.3%, 5/6). In multivariate analysis, surgery (P = .006), and chemotherapy (P = .038) are still independent factors of favorable CSS and OS. For patients with surgery (n = 362), radical surgery was not associated with better survival. CONCLUSION: For stage IV SBA patients, the present study showed that age and primary tumor site were significantly associated with treatment preference. Surgery and chemotherapy were consistently correlated with favorable survival for the whole cohort or most specific subgroups. However, compared with palliative surgery, significant association was not found in patients with radical surgery with better outcome.

Ziel war es, die Patient*innen, die vor einem elektiven Eingriff stehen, in ihrer Entscheidungsfindung zu unterstützen und unnötige medizinische Indikationsstellungen sowie Eingriffe zu vermeiden. Da diese Richtlinie vergleichsweise neu ist, gibt es bisher nur begrenzt Daten und Erkenntnisse hinsichtlich der Umsetzung der Zweitmeinungsrichtlinie und damit verbunden, potentiellen Herausforderungen. Um diese Lücke zu schließen, wurde eine explorativ sequenzielle Mixed-MethodsStudie durchgeführt. Sie bestand aus einer qualitativen Phase mit 22 telefonischen Interviews von Fachärzt*innen der Gynäkologie und Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde sowie einer quantitativen Phase mit einer Fragebogenerhebung unter 136 Ärzt*innen derselben Fachrichtungen. Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigten, dass die befragten Fachärzt*innen eine positive Einstellung zur Zweitmeinung im Allgemeinen haben. Sie sehen Vorteile in Bezug auf die Patientenorientierung, die Unterstützung bei Entscheidungsfindung sowie eine Steigerung der Patientensicherheit. Demgegenüber zeigte sich eine negative Einstellung gegenüber der Zweitmeinungsrichtlinie, die mit strukturellen Herausforderungen, wie einem Mehraufwand in der täglichen Versorgung einhergeht. Die Zweitmeinungsrichtlinie wird aktuell noch nicht wie in der Richtlinie intendiert umgesetzt. Dies ist u.a. auf eine mangelnde Akzeptanz, eine fehlende Sinnhaftigkeit, unzureichendes Wissen hinsichtlich richtlinienrelevanter Aufklärungspflichten sowie Ressourcenanforderungen und die Einschränkung der ärztlichen Autonomie zurückzuführen. Die Studie hebt die Bedeutung hervor, die identifizierten Herausforderungen für eine adäquate Umsetzung der Zweitmeinungsrichtlinie zu fokussieren und mögliche Anpassungen zu diskutieren, um Patient*innen das gesetzlich kodifizierte Recht auf die Inanspruchnahme einer Zweitmeinung zu möglichen.

Against this background the present study analyses the conclusions of global assessments and derives recommendations on how to increase the transformative potential of international negotiations and agreements as well as development cooperation programs, projects, and initiatives. The study develops a conceptual framework building on the academic literature and argues that interventions are much more likely to achieve transformation to sustainability if they are embedded within a more comprehensive framing of transformative change consisting of 1. a compelling transformative vision, 2. knowledge on systemic change, 3. navigation of the dynamics inherent in changing development pathways, and 4. emancipated agency providing room for inclusive deliberation and 5. combine transformative modes of governance. The study identifies core challenges and gaps for the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity in general and for forests and the ocean by (i) examining the recommendations from global assessments and reports on the state of nature and the environment, and (ii) by analysing international cooperation projects for biodiversity, forests and the ocean with regard to their transformative potential. Finally, the study provides recommendations on how Germany can support transformation in the context of international and development cooperation.']",public,,"[{'prefLabel': 'Wittmer, Heidi', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/17182783X'}, {'prefLabel': 'Berghöfer, Augustin', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/133568156'}, {'prefLabel': 'Büttner, Leonie', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Büttner, Leonie'}, {'prefLabel': 'Chakrabarty, Ruchira', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Chakrabarty, Ruchira'}, {'prefLabel': 'Förster, Johannes', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1246229854'}, {'prefLabel': 'Khan, Sabina', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1246230577'}, {'prefLabel': 'König, Claudia', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1122649592'}, {'prefLabel': 'Krause, Gesche', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1228019754'}, {'prefLabel': 'Kreuer, David', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1172464529'}, {'prefLabel': 'Locher Krause, Karla Estela', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1213264200'}, {'prefLabel': 'Moreno Soares, Thais', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Moreno Soares, Thais'}, {'prefLabel': 'Muñoz Escobar, Marcela', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1209907453'}, {'prefLabel': 'Neumann, Malte', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Neumann, Malte'}, {'prefLabel': 'Renner, Isabel', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Renner, Isabel'}, {'prefLabel': 'Rode, Julian', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/1246225263'}, {'prefLabel': 'Schniewind, Imma', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Schniewind, Imma'}, {'prefLabel': 'Schwarzer, Dorothea', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Schwarzer, Dorothea'}, {'prefLabel': 'Tröger, Ulrike', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Tröger, Ulrike'}, {'prefLabel': 'Zinngrebe, Yves', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Zinngrebe, Yves'}, {'prefLabel': 'Spiering, Salina', '@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/author/Spiering, Salina'}, {'prefLabel': 'Helmholtz-Zentrum für Umweltforschung', '@id': 'https://d-nb.info/gnd/10164498-X'}, {'prefLabel': 'Helmholtz-Zentrum für Umweltforschung.

frl:6526241,"['BACKGROUND: The European Union (EU) faces many health-related challenges. Burden of diseases information and the resulting trends over time are essential for health planning. This paper reports estimates of disease burden in the EU and individual 27 EU countries in 2019, and compares them with those in 2010. METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study estimates and 95% uncertainty intervals for the whole EU and each country to evaluate age-standardised death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates for Level 2 causes, as well as life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (HALE). RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardised death and DALY rates in the EU were 465.8 deaths and 20,251.0 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Between 2010 and 2019, there were significant decreases in age-standardised death and YLL rates across EU countries. However, YLD rates remained mainly unchanged. The largest decreases in age-standardised DALY rates were observed for “HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases” and “transport injuries” (each -19%). “Diabetes and kidney diseases” showed a significant increase for age-standardised DALY rates across the EU (3.5%). In addition, “mental disorders” showed an increasing age-standardised YLL rate (14.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear trend towards improvement in the overall health status of the EU but with differences between countries. EU health policymakers need to address the burden of diseases, paying specific attention to causes such as mental disorders. There are many opportunities for mutual learning among otherwise similar countries with different patterns of disease.']",public,['24:1374'],"[{'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/VmFzY28gU2FudG9zLCBKb8Ojbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Vasco Santos, João'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGFkcm9uLU1vbmVkZXJvLCBBbGljaWE=', 'prefLabel': 'Padron-Monedero, Alicia'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/QmlrYm92LCBCb3Jpcw==', 'prefLabel': 'Bikbov, Boris'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R3JhZCwgRGlhbmEgQWxlY3NhbmRyYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Grad, Diana Alecsandra'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGxhc3MsIERpZXRyaWNo', 'prefLabel': 'Plass, Dietrich'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TWVjaGlsaSwgRW5rZWxlaW50IEEu', 'prefLabel': 'Mechili, Enkeleint A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2F6emVsbG9uaSwgRmVkZXJpY2E=', 'prefLabel': 'Gazzelloni, Federica'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RmlzY2hlciwgRmxvcmlhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Fischer, Florian'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U3VsbywgR2VyaGFyZA==', 'prefLabel': 'Sulo, Gerhard'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tmd3YSwgQ2hlIEhlbnJ5', 'prefLabel': 'Ngwa, Che Henry'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Tm9ndWVyLVphbWJyYW5vLCBJc2FiZWw=', 'prefLabel': 'Noguer-Zambrano, Isabel'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/UGXDsWFsdm8sIEpvc8OpIEwu', 'prefLabel': 'Peñalvo, José L.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFhZ3NtYSwgSnVhbml0YSBBLg==', 'prefLabel': 'Haagsma, Juanita A.'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2lzc2ltb3ZhLVNrYXJiZWssIEthdGFyenluYQ==', 'prefLabel': 'Kissimova-Skarbek, Katarzyna'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9uYXN0YSwgTG9yZW56bw==', 'prefLabel': 'Monasta, Lorenzo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/R2hpdGgsIE5lcm1pbg==', 'prefLabel': 'Ghith, Nermin'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/U2FybWllbnRvLVN1YXJleiwgUm9kcmlnbw==', 'prefLabel': 'Sarmiento-Suarez, Rodrigo'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SHJ6aWMsIFJvaw==', 'prefLabel': 'Hrzic, Rok'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/SGFuZWVmLCBSb21hbmE=', 'prefLabel': 'Haneef, Romana'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/T_KAmUNhb2ltaCwgUsOzbsOhbg==', 'prefLabel': 'O’Caoimh, Rónán'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/Q3VzY2hpZXJpLCBTYXJhaA==', 'prefLabel': 'Cuschieri, Sarah'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/TW9uZGVsbG8sIFN0ZWZhbmlh', 'prefLabel': 'Mondello, Stefania'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/S2FiaXIsIFp1YmFpcg==', 'prefLabel': 'Kabir, Zubair'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RnJlaXRhcywgQWxiZXJ0bw==', 'prefLabel': 'Freitas, Alberto'}, {'@id': 'https://frl.publisso.de/adhoc/uri/RGV2bGVlc3NjaGF1d2VyLCBCcmVjaHQ=', 'prefLabel': 'Devleesschauwer, Brecht'}]",2024.0,"[{'@id': 'http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng', 'prefLabel': 'Englisch'}]",['The state of health in the European Union (EU-27) in 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease study 2019'],2025-10-07T09:41:59.746+0200,266.0

In the context of food science, it is essential to reconsider SCG not as waste, but as a potential functional ingredient that can be valorized to reduce environmental impact and enhance nutritional and economic value in food systems. In this study, SCG of Turkish, espresso, or filter coffee was evaluated as a resource of dietary fiber and antioxidants in beef patties during refrigerated storage over 7\u2009days. Physicochemical (pH, water activity, color, cooking loss, diameter reduction, dietary fiber content, and oxidative stability), textural, and sensory traits of beef patties were determined. The spent coffee ground treatment significantly increased the dietary fiber content of the samples (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The lowest TBARS number was found in the groups of treatment (T1, T2, and T3) on the 7th day. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles of selected SCG-derived phytochemicals were assessed using ADMET analysis, revealing favorable bioavailability and non-inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes. Molecular docking studies against the 2FLU (Kelch-Neh2 Complex) target protein demonstrated strong binding interactions, with chlorogenic acid exhibiting the highest affinity (−9.3\u2009kcal/mol, Ki: 0.152\u2009μM). The sensory scores showed that incorporating SCG, especially Turkish and filter coffee grounds, improved the odor properties of beef patties but adversely affected texture due to their fibrous and porous nature. Yet, general consumer acceptability was higher for these samples compared to the control group. As a result, utilizing SCG as a resource of antioxidants and dietary fiber in meat products represents a viable, natural, and cost-effective solution for the meat industry.']",public,"['13(1,Spec.

frl:6489521,"['Plant protection is a necessary part of any agricultural practice to secure yields and to use applied resources effectively. The basis of integrated crop protection is preventive measures followed, if necessary, by physical, biological -biotechnical and chemical measures. In chemical crop protection, new active substances and formulations (e.g. nano-pesticides) will continue to be developed, although probably not to the same extent as before. In general, there is a trend towards biopesticides, due to their often higher specificity combined with low persistence in the environment. Physical methods will play a greater role, especially in weed control. Variety selection is already an important pillar of preventive plant protection, and new smart breeding methods allow a more targeted and faster supply of plants with resistance to certain diseases or pests. Digitalisation can lead to a significant reduction in the use of pesticides through improved sensor technology, robotics and the use of large amounts of data (big data), because application can be more precise in terms of space and time (precision farming). Physical measures can also be more targeted. Small-scale cultivation (e.g. spot farming) and mixed crops as an alternative to large fields with a close crop rotation are technically simplified and thus economically more profitable. Overall, the new developments are expected to have positive effects on biodiversity in the agricultural landscape, as chemical agents can increasingly be replaced or used in a more targeted manner. In addition to the preventive effect against pests, new diverse cultivation methods have the additional advantage of directly increasing agricultural biodiversity and thus structural diversity in the agricultural landscape. Prerequisites for the successful implementation of the measures are the provision of the necessary infrastructure, appropriate consideration in regulation, adaptation of funding measures, as well as the clarification of questions regarding data sovereignty, data security and data protection.', 'Pflanzenschutz ist ein notwendiger Bestandteil jeder landwirtschaftlichen Praxis, um Erträge zu sichern und eingesetzte Ressourcen effektiv zu nutzen. Grundlage des Integrierten Pflanzenschutzes sind vorbeugende Maßnahmen, bei Bedarf gefolgt von physikalischen, biologischen -biotechnischen und chemischen Maßnahmen. Im chemischen Pflanzenschutz wird es weiterhin neue Wirkstoffe und Formulierungen (z.B. Nanopestizide) geben, wenn auch voraussichtlich nicht mehr in dem Umfang wie bisher. Generell wird ein Trend zu biologischen Pflanzenschutzmitteln festgestellt, da hier oft eine höhere Spezifität bei geringer Persistenz in der Umwelt erreicht werden kann. Physikalische Verfahren werden vor allem in der Beikrautbekämpfung eine größere Rolle spielen. Die Sortenwahl stellt bisher schon eine wichtige Säule des vorbeugenden Pflanzenschutzes dar und Verfahren des Smart Breeding erlauben eine gezieltere und schnellere Bereitstellung von Pflanzen mit Resistenzen gegen bestimmte Krankheiten oder Schädlinge. Digitalisierung kann durch verbesserte Sensorik, Robotik, und Nutzung großer Datenmengen (Big data) zur deutlichen Reduzierung des Einsatzes von Pflanzenschutzmitteln führen, weil räumlich und zeitlich genauer appliziert werden kann (Precision Farming). Physikalische Maßnahmen können ebenso gezielter erfolgen. Kleinräumigerer Anbau (z.B. spot farming) und Mischkulturen als Alternative zu großen Schlägen und Fruchtfolgen mit nur wenigen Kulturpflanzen werden technisch vereinfacht und damit wirtschaftlich lohnender. Insgesamt werden durch die neuen Entwicklungen positive Effekte auf die Biodiversität in der Agrarlandschaft erwartet, da chemische Mittel verstärkt ersetzt oder gezielter eingesetzt werden können. Solche Anbauverfahren haben neben der vorbeugenden Wirkung gegen Schädlinge zusätzlich den Vorteil die Agrarbiodiversität und damit die Strukturvielfalt in der Agrarlandschaft direkt zu erhöhen.
